<p>To copyleft or not to copyleft? That is one of the major controversies in the free 
software community. The idea of copyleft is that we should fight fire with fire--that we 
should use copyright to make sure our code stays free. The GNU GPL is one example of a 
copyleft license. </p>

<p>Some free software developers prefer non-copyleft distribution. Non-copyleft licenses 
such as the XFree86 and <a HREF="/philosophy/bsd.html">BSD </a>licenses are based on the 
idea of never saying no to anyone--not even to someone who seeks to use your work as the 
basis for restricting other people. Non-copyleft licensing does nothing wrong, but it 
misses the opportunity to actively protect our freedom to change and redistribute 
software. For that, we need copyleft. </p>

<p>For many years, the X Consortium was the chief opponent of copyleft. It exerted both 
moral suasion and pressure to discourage free software developers from copylefting their 
programs. It used moral suasion by suggesting that it is not nice to say no. It used 
pressure through its rule that copylefted software could not be in the X Distribution. </p>

<p>Why did the X Consortium adopt this policy? It had to do with their definition of 
success. The X Consortium defined success as popularity--specifically, getting computer 
companies to use the X Window System. This definition put the computer companies in the 
driver's seat. Whatever they wanted, the X Consortium had to help them get it. </p>

<p>Computer companies normally distribute proprietary software. They wanted free software 
developers to donate their work for such use. If they had asked for this directly, people 
would have laughed. But the X Consortium, fronting for them, could present this request as 
an unselfish one. ``Join us in donating our work to proprietary software developers,'' 
they said, suggesting that this is a noble form of self-sacrifice. ``Join us in achieving 
popularity,'' they said, suggesting that it was not even a sacrifice. </p>

<p>But self-sacrifice is not the issue: tossing away the defense that copyleft provides, 
which protects the freedom of the whole community, is sacrificing more than yourself. 
Those who granted the X Consortium's request entrusted the community's future to the good 
will of the X Consortium. </p>

<p>This trust was misplaced. In its last year, the X Consortium made a plan to restrict 
the forthcoming X11R6.4 release so that it will not be free software. They decided to 
start saying no, not only to proprietary software developers, but to our community as 
well. </p>

<p>There is an irony here. If you said yes when the X Consortium asked you not to use 
copyleft, you put the X Consortium in a position to license and restrict its version of 
your program, along with the code for the core of X. </p>

<p>The X Consortium did not carry out this plan. Instead it closed down and transferred X 
development to the Open Group, whose staff are now carrying out a similar plan. To give 
them credit, when I asked them to release X11R6.4 under the GNU GPL in parallel with their 
planned restrictive license, they were willing to consider the idea. (They were firmly 
against staying with the old X11 distribution terms.) Before they said yes or no to this 
proposal, it had already failed for another reason: the <a HREF="http://www.xfree86.org/">XFree86 
</a>group follows the X Consortium's old policy, and will not accept copylefted software. </p>

<p>[In September 1998, several months after X11R6.4 was released with non-free distribtion 
terms, the Open Group reversed its decision and rereleased it under the same non-copyleft 
free software license that was used for X11R6.3. Thank you, Open Group.] </p>

<p>Even if the X Consortium and the Open Group had never planned to restrict X, someone 
else could have done it. Non-copylefted software is vulnerable from all directions; it 
lets anyone make a non-free version dominant, if he will invest sufficient resources to 
add significantly important features using proprietary code. Users who choose software 
based on technical characteristics, rather than on freedom, could easily be lured to the 
non-free version for short-term convenience. </p>

<p>The X Consortium and Open Group can no longer exert moral suasion by saying that it is 
wrong to say no. This will make it easier to decide to copyleft your X-related software. </p>

<p>When you work on the core of X, on programs such as the X server, Xlib, and Xt, there 
is a practical reason not to use copyleft. The XFree86 group does an important job for the 
community in maintaining these programs, and the benefit of copylefting our changes would 
be less than the harm done by a fork in development. So it is better to work with the 
XFree86 group and not copyleft our changes on these programs. Likewise for utilities such 
as xset and xrdb, which are close to the core of X, and which do not need major 
improvements. At least we know that the XFree86 group has a firm commitment to developing 
these programs as free software. </p>

<p>The issue is different for programs outside the core of X: applications, window 
managers, and additional libraries and widgets. There is no reason not to copyleft them, 
and we should copyleft them. </p>

<p>In case anyone feels the pressure exerted by the criteria for inclusion in the X 
distributions, the GNU project will undertake to publicize copylefted packages that work 
with X. If you would like to copyleft something, and you worry that its omission from the 
X distribution will impede its popularity, please ask us to help. </p>

<p>At the same time, it is better if we do not feel too much need for popularity. When a 
businessman tempts you with ``more popularity,'' he may try to convince you that his use 
of your program is crucial to its success. Don't believe it! If your program is good, it 
will find many users anyway; you don't need to feel desperate for any particular users, 
and you will be stronger if you do not. You can get an indescribable sense of joy and 
freedom by responding, ``Take it or leave it--that's no skin off my back.'' Often the 
businessman will turn around and accept the program with copyleft, once you call the 
bluff. </p>

<p>Friends, free software developers, don't repeat a mistake. If we do not copyleft our 
software, we put its future at the mercy of anyone equipped with more resources than 
scruples. With copyleft, we can defend freedom, not just for ourselves, but for our whole 
community. </p>
