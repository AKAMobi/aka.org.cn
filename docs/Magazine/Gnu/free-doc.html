<h3>Free Software and Free Manuals</h3>

<p>The biggest deficiency in free operating systems is not in the software--it is the lack 
of good free manuals that we can include in these systems. Many of our most important 
programs do not come with full manuals. Documentation is an essential part of any software 
package; when an important free software package does not come with a free manual, that is 
a major gap. We have many such gaps today. </p>

<p>Once upon a time, many years ago, I thought I would learn Perl. I got a copy of a free 
manual, but I found it hard to read. When I asked Perl users about alternatives, they told 
me that there were better introductory manuals--but those were not free. </p>

<p>Why was this? The authors of the good manuals had written them for O'Reilly Associates, 
which published them with restrictive terms--no copying, no modification, source files not 
available--which exclude them from the free software community. </p>

<p>That wasn't the first time this sort of thing has happened, and (to our community's 
great loss) it was far from the last. Proprietary manual publishers have enticed a great 
many authors to restrict their manuals since then. Many times I have heard a GNU user 
eagerly tell me about a manual that he is writing, with which he expects to help the GNU 
project--and then had my hopes dashed, as he proceeded to explain that he had signed a 
contract with a publisher that would restrict it so that we cannot use it. </p>

<p>Given that writing good English is a rare skill among programmers, we can ill afford to 
lose manuals this way. </p>

<p>Free documentation, like free software, is a matter of freedom, not price. The problem 
with these manuals was not that O'Reilly Associates charged a price for printed 
copies--that in itself is fine. (The Free Software Foundation <a
HREF="/doc/doc.html#DescriptionsOfGNUDocumentation">sells printed copies</a> of free <a
HREF="/doc/doc.html">GNU manuals</a>, too.) But GNU manuals are available in source code 
form, while these manuals are available only on paper. GNU manuals come with permission to 
copy and modify; the Perl manuals do not. These restrictions are the problems. </p>

<p>The criterion for a free manual is pretty much the same as for free software: it is a 
matter of giving all users certain freedoms. Redistribution (including commercial 
redistribution) must be permitted, so that the manual can accompany every copy of the 
program, on-line or on paper. Permission for modification is crucial too. </p>

<p>As a general rule, I don't believe that it is essential for people to have permission 
to modify all sorts of articles and books. The issues for writings are not necessarily the 
same as those for software. For example, I don't think you or I are obliged to give 
permission to modify articles like this one, which describe our actions and our views. </p>

<p>But there is a particular reason why the freedom to modify is crucial for documentation 
for free software. When people exercise their right to modify the software, and add or 
change its features, if they are conscientious they will change the manual too--so they 
can provide accurate and usable documentation with the modified program. A manual which 
forbids programmers to be conscientious and finish the job, or more precisely requires 
them to write a new manual from scratch if they change the program, does not fill our 
community's needs. </p>

<p>While a blanket prohibition on modification is unacceptable, some kinds of limits on 
the method of modification pose no problem. For example, requirements to preserve the 
original author's copyright notice, the distribution terms, or the list of authors, are 
ok. It is also no problem to require modified versions to include notice that they were 
modified, even to have entire sections that may not be deleted or changed, as long as 
these sections deal with nontechnical topics. (Some GNU manuals have them.) </p>

<p>These kinds of restrictions are not a problem because, as a practical matter, they 
don't stop the conscientious programmer from adapting the manual to fit the modified 
program. In other words, they don't block the free software community from making full use 
of the manual. </p>

<p>However, it must be possible to modify all the <em>technical</em> content of the 
manual, and then distribute the result in all the usual media, through all the usual 
channels; otherwise, the restrictions do block the community, the manual is not free, and 
so we need another manual. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, it is often hard to find someone to write another manual when a 
proprietary manual exists. The obstacle is that many users think that a proprietary manual 
is good enough--so they don't see the need to write a free manual. They do not see that 
the free operating system has a gap that needs filling. </p>

<p>Why do users think that proprietary manuals are good enough? Some have not considered 
the issue. I hope this article will do something to change that. </p>

<p>Other users consider proprietary manuals acceptable for the same reason so many people 
consider proprietary software acceptable: they judge in purely practical terms, not using 
freedom as a criterion. These people are entitled to their opinions, but since those 
opinions spring from values which do not include freedom, they are no guide for those of 
us who do value freedom. </p>

<p>Please spread the word about this issue. We continue to lose manuals to proprietary 
publishing. If we spread the word that proprietary manuals are not sufficient, perhaps the 
next person who wants to help GNU by writing documentation will realize, before it is too 
late, that he must above all make it free. </p>

<p>We can also encourage commercial publishers to sell free, copylefted manuals instead of 
proprietary ones. One way you can help this is to check the distribution terms of a manual 
before you buy it, and prefer copylefted manuals to non-copylefted ones. </p>
