<P>So far, we have described how a stream of data is broken up into datagrams, 
sent to another computer, and put back together. However something more is 
needed in order to accomplish anything useful. There has to be a way for you to 
open a connection to a specified computer, log into it, tell it what file you 
want, and control the transmission of the file. (If you have a different 
application in mind, e.g. computer mail, some analogous protocol is needed.) 
This is done by "application protocols". The application protocols run "on top" 
of TCP/IP. That is, when they want to send a message, they give the message to 
TCP. TCP makes sure it gets delivered to the other end. Because TCP and IP take 
care of all the networking details, the applications protocols can treat a 
network connection as if it were a simple byte stream, like a terminal or phone 
line. 
<P>Before going into more details about applications programs, we have to 
describe how you find an application. Suppose you want to send a file to a 
computer whose Internet address is 128.6.4.7. To start the process, you need 
more than just the Internet address. You have to connect to the FTP server at 
the other end. In general, network programs are specialized for a specific set 
of tasks. Most systems have separate programs to handle file transfers, remote 
terminal logins, mail, etc. When you connect to 128.6.4.7, you have to specify 
that you want to talk to the FTP server. This is done by having "well-known 
sockets" for each server. Recall that TCP uses port numbers to keep track of 
individual conversations. User programs normally use more or less random port 
numbers. However specific port numbers are assigned to the programs that sit 
waiting for requests. For example, if you want to send a file, you will start a 
program called "ftp". It will open a connection using some random number, say 
1234, for the port number on its end. However it will specify port number 21 for 
the other end. This is the official port number for the FTP server. Note that 
there are two different programs involved. You run ftp on your side. This is a 
program designed to accept commands from your terminal and pass them on to the 
other end. The program that you talk to on the other machine is the FTP server. 
It is designed to accept commands from the network connection, rather than an 
interactive terminal. There is no need for your program to use a well-known 
socket number for itself. Nobody is trying to find it. However the servers have 
to have well-known numbers, so that people can open connections to them and 
start sending them commands. The official port numbers for each program are 
given in "Assigned Numbers". 
<P>Note that a connection is actually described by a set of 4 numbers: the 
Internet address at each end, and the TCP port number at each end. Every 
datagram has all four of those numbers in it. (The Internet addresses are in the 
IP header, and the TCP port numbers are in the TCP header.) In order to keep 
things straight, no two connections can have the same set of numbers. However it 
is enough for any one number to be different. For example, it is perfectly 
possible for two different users on a machine to be sending files to the same 
other machine. This could result in connections with the following parameters: <PRE>                   Internet addresses         TCP ports
    connection 1  128.6.4.194, 128.6.4.7      1234, 21
    connection 2  128.6.4.194, 128.6.4.7      1235, 21
</PRE>
<P>Since the same machines are involved, the Internet addresses are the same. 
Since they are both doing file transfers, one end of the connection involves the 
well-known port number for FTP. The only thing that differs is the port number 
for the program that the users are running. That's enough of a difference. 
Generally, at least one end of the connection asks the network software to 
assign it a port number that is guaranteed to be unique. Normally, it's the 
user's end, since the server has to use a well-known number. 
<P>Now that we know how to open connections, let's get back to the applications 
programs. As mentioned earlier, once TCP has opened a connection, we have 
something that might as well be a simple wire. All the hard parts are handled by 
TCP and IP. However we still need some agreement as to what we send over this 
connection. In effect this is simply an agreement on what set of commands the 
application will understand, and the format in which they are to be sent. 
Generally, what is sent is a combination of commands and data. They use context 
to differentiate. For example, the mail protocol works like this: Your mail 
program opens a connection to the mail server at the other end. Your program 
gives it your machine's name, the sender of the message, and the recipients you 
want it sent to. It then sends a command saying that it is starting the message. 
At that point, the other end stops treating what it sees as commands, and starts 
accepting the message. Your end then starts sending the text of the message. At 
the end of the message, a special mark is sent (a dot in the first column). 
After that, both ends understand that your program is again sending commands. 
This is the simplest way to do things, and the one that most applications use. 
<P>File transfer is somewhat more complex. The file transfer protocol involves 
two different connections. It starts out just like mail. The user's program 
sends commands like "log me in as this user", "here is my password", "send me 
the file with this name". However once the command to send data is sent, a 
second connection is opened for the data itself. It would certainly be possible 
to send the data on the same connection, as mail does. However file transfers 
often take a long time. The designers of the file transfer protocol wanted to 
allow the user to continue issuing commands while the transfer is going on. For 
example, the user might make an inquiry, or he might abort the transfer. Thus 
the designers felt it was best to use a separate connection for the data and 
leave the original command connection for commands. (It is also possible to open 
command connections to two different computers, and tell them to send a file 
from one to the other. In that case, the data couldn't go over the command 
connection.) 
<P>Remote terminal connections use another mechanism still. For remote logins, 
there is just one connection. It normally sends data. When it is necessary to 
send a command (e.g. to set the terminal type or to change some mode), a special 
character is used to indicate that the next character is a command. If the user 
happens to type that special character as data, two of them are sent. 
<P>We are not going to describe the application protocols in detail in this 
document. It's better to read the RFC's yourself. However there are a couple of 
common conventions used by applications that will be described here. First, the 
common network representation: TCP/IP is intended to be usable on any computer. 
Unfortunately, not all computers agree on how data is represented. There are 
differences in character codes (ASCII vs. EBCDIC), in end of line conventions 
(carriage return, line feed, or a representation using counts), and in whether 
terminals expect characters to be sent individually or a line at a time. In 
order to allow computers of different kinds to communicate, each applications 
protocol defines a standard representation. Note that TCP and IP do not care 
about the representation. TCP simply sends octets. However the programs at both 
ends have to agree on how the octets are to be interpreted. The RFC for each 
application specifies the standard representation for that application. Normally 
it is "net ASCII". This uses ASCII characters, with end of line denoted by a 
carriage return followed by a line feed. For remote login, there is also a 
definition of a "standard terminal", which turns out to be a half-duplex 
terminal with echoing happening on the local machine. Most applications also 
make provisions for the two computers to agree on other representations that 
they may find more convenient. For example, PDP-10's have 36-bit words. There is 
a way that two PDP-10's can agree to send a 36-bit binary file. Similarly, two 
systems that prefer full-duplex terminal conversations can agree on that. 
However each application has a standard representation, which every machine must 
support. 
<H3>An example application: SMTP</H3>
<P>In order to give a bit better idea what is involved in the application 
protocols, I'm going to show an example of SMTP, which is the mail protocol. 
(SMTP is "simple mail transfer protocol.) We assume that a computer called 
TOPAZ.RUTGERS.EDU wants to send the following message. <PRE>  Date: Sat, 27 Jun 87 13:26:31 EDT
  From: hedrick@topaz.rutgers.edu
  To: levy@red.rutgers.edu
  Subject: meeting

  Let's get together Monday at 1pm.
</PRE>
<P>First, note that the format of the message itself is described by an Internet 
standard (RFC 822). The standard specifies the fact that the message must be 
transmitted as net ASCII (i.e. it must be ASCII, with carriage return/linefeed 
to delimit lines). It also describes the general structure, as a group of header 
lines, then a blank line, and then the body of the message. Finally, it 
describes the syntax of the header lines in detail. Generally they consist of a 
keyword and then a value. 
<P>Note that the addressee is indicated as LEVY@RED.RUTGERS.EDU. Initially, 
addresses were simply "person at machine". However recent standards have made 
things more flexible. There are now provisions for systems to handle other 
systems' mail. This can allow automatic forwarding on behalf of computers not 
connected to the Internet. It can be used to direct mail for a number of systems 
to one central mail server. Indeed there is no requirement that an actual 
computer by the name of RED.RUTGERS.EDU even exist. The name servers could be 
set up so that you mail to department names, and each department's mail is 
routed automatically to an appropriate computer. It is also possible that the 
part before the @ is something other than a user name. It is possible for 
programs to be set up to process mail. There are also provisions to handle 
mailing lists, and generic names such as "postmaster" or "operator". 
<P>The way the message is to be sent to another system is described by RFC's 821 
and 974. The program that is going to be doing the sending asks the name server 
several queries to determine where to route the message. The first query is to 
find out which machines handle mail for the name RED.RUTGERS.EDU. In this case, 
the server replies that RED.RUTGERS.EDU handles its own mail. The program then 
asks for the address of RED.RUTGERS.EDU, which is 128.6.4.2. Then the mail 
program opens a TCP connection to port 25 on 128.6.4.2. Port 25 is the 
well-known socket used for receiving mail. Once this connection is established, 
the mail program starts sending commands. Here is a typical conversation. Each 
line is labelled as to whether it is from TOPAZ or RED. Note that TOPAZ 
initiated the connection: <PRE>    RED    220 RED.RUTGERS.EDU SMTP Service at 29 Jun 87 05:17:18 EDT

<PRE><P>First, note that commands all use normal text.  This is typical of the
Internet  standards.    Many  of  the  protocols  use  standard  ASCII
commands.  This makes it easy  to  watch  what  is  going  on  and  to
diagnose  problems.  For example, the mail program keeps a log of each
conversation.  If something goes wrong, the log  file  can  simply  be
mailed  to  the  postmaster.  Since it is normal text, he can see what
was going on.  It also allows a human to interact  directly  with  the
mail  server,  for  testing.  (Some newer protocols are complex enough
that this is not practical.  The commands would have to have a  syntax
that would require a significant parser.  Thus there is a tendency for
newer protocols to use binary formats.  Generally they are  structured
like  C or Pascal record structures.)  Second, note that the responses
all begin with numbers.  This is also typical of  Internet  protocols.
The  allowable  responses  are  defined  in the protocol.  The numbers
allow the user program to respond unambiguously.    The  rest  of  the
response  is  text,  which is normally for use by any human who may be
watching or looking at a log.  It has no effect on  the  operation  of
the  programs.  (However there is one point at which the protocol uses
part of the text of the response.)   The  commands  themselves  simply
allow  the  mail  program  on  one  end  to  tell  the mail server the
information it needs to know in order to deliver the message.  In this
case,  the  mail  server  could  get the information by looking at the
message itself.  But for more complex cases, that would not  be  safe.
Every  session  must  begin  with  a HELO, which gives the name of the
system that initiated the connection.  Then the sender and  recipients
are specified.  (There can be more than one RCPT command, if there are
several recipients.)  Finally the data itself is sent.  Note that  the
text  of the message is terminated by a line containing just a period.
(If such a line appears in the message, the period is doubled.)  After
the  message  is  accepted,  the  sender  can send another message, or
terminate the session as in the example above.

<P>Generally, there is a pattern to the response numbers.   The  protocol
defines  the  specific set of responses that can be sent as answers to
any given command.  However programs that don't want to  analyze  them
in  detail  can  just  look at the first digit.  In general, responses
that begin with a 2  indicate  success.    Those  that  begin  with  3
indicate  that some further action is needed, as shown above.  4 and 5
indicate errors.  4 is a "temporary" error, such as  a  disk  filling.
The  message should be saved, and tried again later.  5 is a permanent
error, such as a  non-existent  recipient.    The  message  should  be
returned to the sender with an error message.

<P>(For  more  details about the protocols mentioned in this section, see
RFC's 821/822 for mail, RFC 959 for file transfer, and  RFC's  854/855
for  remote  logins.  For the well-known port numbers, see the current
edition of Assigned Numbers, and possibly RFC 814.>
