            <P>The Internet was started in 1969 under a contract let by the 
            Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) which connected four major 
            computers at universities in the southwestern US (UCLA, Stanford 
            Research Institute, UCSB, and the University of Utah). The contract 
            was carried out by BBN of Cambridge, MA and went online in December 
            1969. By June 1970, MIT, Harvard, BBN, and Systems Development Corp 
            (SDC) in Santa Monica, Cal. were added. By January 1971, Stanford, 
            MIT's Lincoln Labs, Carnegie-Mellon, and Case-Western Reserve U were 
            added. In months to come, NASA/Ames, Mitre, Burroughs, RAND, and the 
            U of Illinois plugged in. After that, there were far too many to 
            keep listing here.</P>

                <TD>When Senator Ted Kennedy heard in 1968 that BBN had won 
                  the ARPA contract for an "interface message processor (IMP)," 
                  he sent a congratulatory telegram to BBN for their ecumenical 
                  spirit in winning the "interfaith message processor" contract.

            <P>The Internet was designed to provide a communications network 
            that would work even if some of the sites were destroyed by nuclear 
            attack. If the most direct route was not available, routers 
            would direct traffic around the network via alternate routes.</P>
            <P>The early Internet was used by computer experts, engineers, and 
            scientists. There was nothing friendly about it. There were no home 
            or office personal computers in those days, and anyone who used it, 
            whether a computer professional or an engineer or scientist, had to 
            learn to use a very complex system.</P><A name=metcalfe></A>

                <TD>Ethernet, a protocol for many local networks, appeared in 
                  1974, an outgrowth of Harvard student Bob Metcalfe's 
                  dissertation on "Packet Networks." The dissertation was 
                  initially rejected by the University for not being analytical 
                  enough. It later won acceptance when he added some more 
                  equations to it. </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
            <P>The Internet matured in the 70's as a result of the TCP/IP 
            architecture first proposed by Bob Kahn at BBN and further developed 
            by Kahn and Vint Cerf at Stanford and others throughout the 70's. It 
            was adopted by the Defense Department in 1980 and universally 
            adopted by 1983. 
            <P>The Unix to Unix Copy Protocol (UUCP) was invented in 1978 at 
            Bell Labs. Usenet was started in 1979 based on UUCP. Newsgroups, 
            which are discussion groups focusing on a topic, followed, providing 
            a means of exchanging information throughout the world . While 
            Usenet is not considered as part of the Internet, since it does not 
            share the use of TCP/IP, it linked unix systems around the world, 
            and many Internet sites took advantage of the availability of 
            newsgroups. It was a significant part of the community building that 
            took place on the networks.</P>
            <P>Similarly, BITNET (Because It's Time Network) connected IBM 
            mainframes around the educational community and the world to provide 
            mail services beginning in 1981. Listserv 
            software was developed for this network and later others. Gateways 
            were developed to connect BITNET with the Internet and allowed 
            exchange of e-mail, particularly for e-mail discussion lists. These 
            listservs and other forms of e-mail discussion lists formed another 
            major element in the community building that was taking place. 
            <P>As the commands for e-mail, 
   FTP, 
            and telnet
            were standardized, it became a lot easier for non-technical people 
            to learn to use the nets. It was not easy by today's standards by 
            any means, but it did open up use of the Internet to many more 
            people in universities, in particular. Other departments besides the 
            computer, physics, and engineering departments found ways to make 
            good use of the nets--to communicate with colleagues around the 
            world and to share files and resources. Libraries, which had been 
            automating their catalogs went a step further and made their 
            automated catalogs available to the world.</P>
            <P>While the number of sites on the Internet was small, it was 
            fairly easy to keep track of the resources of interest that were 
            available. But as more and more universities and organizations 
            connected, the Internet became harder and harder to track. There was 
            more and more need for tools to index the resources that were 
            available.</P>
            <P><a name =archie></a>The first effort to index the Internet was 
            created in 1989, as Peter Deutsch and his crew at McGill University 
            in Montreal, created an archiver for ftp sites, which they named Archie.
            This software would periodically reach out to all known openly 
            available ftp sites, list their files, and build a searchable index 
            of the software. The commands to search Archie were unix commands, 
            and it took some knowledge of unix to use it to its full 
            capability.</P>
            <P>

              <TBODY>
              <TR>
                <TD>McGill University, which hosted the first Archie, found 
                  out one day that half the Internet traffic going into Canada 
                  from the United States was accessing Archie. Administrators 
                  were concerned that the University was subsidizing such a 
                  volume of traffic, and closed down Archie to outside access. 
                  Fortunately, by that time, there were many more Archies 
                  available. </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
            <P><A name=wais></A>At about the same time, Brewster Kahle, then at 
            Thinking Machines, Corp. developed his Wide Area Information Server 
            (WAIS), 
            which would index the full text of files in a database and allow 
            searches of the files. There were several versions with varying 
            degrees of complexity and capability developed, but the simplest of 
            these were made available to everyone on the nets. At its peak, 
            Thinking Machines maintained pointers to over 600 databases around 
            the world which had been indexed by WAIS. They included such things 
            as the full set of Usenet Frequently Asked Questions files, the full 
            documentation of working papers by those developing the Internet's 
            standards, and much more. Like Archie, its interface was far from 
            intuitive, and it took some effort to learn to use it well.</P>
            <P><A name=gopher></A>In 1991, the first friendly interface to the 
            Internet was developed at the University of Minnesota. The 
            University wanted to develop a simple menu system to access files 
            and information on campus through their local network. A debate 
            followed between mainframe adherents and those who believed in 
            smaller systems with client-server 
            architecture. The mainframe adherents "won" the debate 
            initially, but since the client-server advocates said they could put 
            up a prototype very quickly, they were given the go-ahead to do a 
            demonstration system. The demonstration system was called a gopher 
            after the U of Minnesota mascot--the golden gopher. The gopher 
            proved to be very prolific, and within a few years there were over 
            10,000 gophers around the world. It takes no knowledge of unix or 
            computer architecture to use. In a gopher system, you type or click 
            on a number to select the menu selection you want. You can use the U 
            of Minnesota gopher today to pick <A 
            href="gopher://gopher.tc.umn.edu/11/Other%20Gopher%20and%20Information%20Servers">gophers 
            from all over the World</A></P>
            <P>Gopher's usability was enhanced much more when the University of 
            Nevada at Reno developed the VERONICA 
            searchable index of gopher menus. It was purported to be an acronym 
            for Very Easy Rodent-Oriented Netwide Index to Computerized 
            Archives. A spider 
            crawled gopher menus around the world, collecting links and 
            retrieving them for the index. It was so popular that it was very 
            hard to connect to, even though a number of other VERONICA sites 
            were developed to ease the load. Similar indexing software was 
            developed for single sites, called JUGHEAD 
            (Jonzy's Universal Gopher Hierarchy Excavation And Display).

                <TD>Peter Deutsch, who developed Archie, always insisted that 
                  Archie was short for Archiver, and had nothing to do with the 
                  comic strip. He was disgusted when VERONICA and JUGHEAD 
                  appeared. </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
            <P><A name=www></A>In 1989 another significant event took place in 
            making the nets easier to use. Tim Berners-Lee and others at the 
            European Laboratory for Particle Physics, more popularly known as 
            CERN, proposed a new protocol for information distribution. This 
            protocol, which became the World Wide Web in 1991, was based on 
            hypertext--a system of embedding links in text to link to other 
            text, which you have been using every time you selected a text link 
            while reading these pages. Although started before gopher, it was 
            slower to develop. 
            <P>The development in 1993 of the graphical browser Mosaic 
            by Marc Andreessen and his team at the <A 
            href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/">National Center For Supercomputing 
            Applications (NCSA) </A>gave the protocol its big boost. Today, 
            Andreessen is the brains behind <A 
            href="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape Corp</A>., which produces 
            what has been so far the most successful graphical type of browser 
            and server, a condition which <A 
            href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</A> is trying very hard 
            to overcome.</P>
            <P>Since the Internet was initially funded by the government, it was 
            originally limited to research, education, and government uses. 
            Commercial uses were prohibited unless they directly served the 
            goals of research and education. This policy continued until the 
            early 90's, when independent commercial networks began to grow. It 
            then became possible to route traffic across the country from one 
            commercial site to another without passing through the government 
            funded Internet backbone.</P>
            <P>Delphi was the first national commercial online service to offer 
            Internet access to its subscribers. It opened up an email connection 
            in July 1992 and full Internet service in November 1992. All 
            pretenses of limitations on commercial use disappeared in May 1995 
            when the National Science Foundation ended its sponsorship of the 
            Internet backbone, and all traffic relied on commercial networks. 
            AOL, Prodigy, and CompuServe came online. Since commercial usage was 
            so widespread by this time and educational institutions had been 
            paying their own way for some time, the loss of NSF funding had no 
            appreciable effect on costs.</P>
            <P>Today, NSF funding has moved beyond supporting the backbone and 
            higher educational institutions to building the K-12 and local 
            public library accesses on the one hand, and the research on the 
            massive high volume connections on the other.</P>
            <P>Microsoft's full scale entry into the browser, server, and 
            Internet Service Provider market completed the major shift over to a 
            commercially based Internet. The release of Windows 98 in June 1998 
            with the Microsoft browser well integrated into the desktop shows 
            Bill Gates' determination to capitalize on the enormous growth of 
            the Internet. Microsoft's success over the past few years has 
            brought court challenges to their dominance. We'll leave it up to 
            you whether you think these battles should be played out in the 
            courts or the marketplace.</P>
            <P>A current trend with major implications for the future is the 
            growth of high speed connections. 56K modems and the providers who 
            support them are spreading widely, but this is just a small step 
            compared to what will follow. 56K is not fast enough to carry 
            multimedia, such as sound and video except in low quality. But new 
            technologies many times faster, such as cablemodems, digital 
            subscriber lines (DSL), and 
            satellite broadcast are available in limited locations now, and will 
            become widely available in the next few years. These technologies 
            present problems, not just in the user's connection, but in 
            maintaining high speed data flow reliably from source to the user. 
            Those problems are being worked on, too.</P>
            <P>During this period of enormous growth, businesses entering the 
            Internet arena are scrambling to find economic models that work. 
            Free services supported by advertising have shifted some of the 
            direct costs away from the consumer. Services such as Delphi are now 
            offering free web pages, chat rooms, and message boards. Online 
            sales are growing rapidly for such products as books and music CDs 
            and computers, but the profit margins are slim when price 
            comparisons are so easy, and public trust in online security is 
            still shaky.</P>We live in interesting times!
