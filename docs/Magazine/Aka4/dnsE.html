<P>As we indicated earlier, the network software generally needs a 32-bit 
Internet address in order to open a connection or send a datagram. However users 
prefer to deal with computer names rather than numbers. Thus there is a database 
that allows the software to look up a name and find the corresponding number. 
When the Internet was small, this was easy. Each system would have a file that 
listed all of the other systems, giving both their name and number. There are 
now too many computers for this approach to be practical. Thus these files have 
been replaced by a set of name servers that keep track of host names and the 
corresponding Internet addresses. (In fact these servers are somewhat more 
general than that. This is just one kind of information stored in the domain 
system.) Note that a set of interlocking servers are used, rather than a single 
central one. There are now so many different institutions connected to the 
Internet that it would be impractical for them to notify a central authority 
whenever they installed or moved a computer. Thus naming authority is delegated 
to individual institutions. The name servers form a tree, corresponding to 
institutional structure. The names themselves follow a similar structure. A 
typical example is the name BORAX.LCS.MIT.EDU. This is a computer at the 
Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS) at MIT. In order to find its Internet 
address, you might potentially have to consult 4 different servers. First, you 
would ask a central server (called the root) where the EDU server is. EDU is a 
server that keeps track of educational institutions. The root server would give 
you the names and Internet addresses of several servers for EDU. (There are 
several servers at each level, to allow for the possibly that one might be 
down.) You would then ask EDU where the server for MIT is. Again, it would give 
you names and Internet addresses of several servers for MIT. Generally, not all 
of those servers would be at MIT, to allow for the possibility of a general 
power failure at MIT. Then you would ask MIT where the server for LCS is, and 
finally you would ask one of the LCS servers about BORAX. The final result would 
be the Internet address for BORAX.LCS.MIT.EDU. Each of these levels is referred 
to as a "domain". The entire name, BORAX.LCS.MIT.EDU, is called a "domain name". 
(So are the names of the higher-level domains, such as LCS.MIT.EDU, MIT.EDU, and 
EDU.) 
<P>Fortunately, you don't really have to go through all of this most of the 
time. First of all, the root name servers also happen to be the name servers for 
the top-level domains such as EDU. Thus a single query to a root server will get 
you to MIT. Second, software generally remembers answers that it got before. So 
once we look up a name at LCS.MIT.EDU, our software remembers where to find 
servers for LCS.MIT.EDU, MIT.EDU, and EDU. It also remembers the translation of 
BORAX.LCS.MIT.EDU. Each of these pieces of information has a "time to live" 
associated with it. Typically this is a few days. After that, the information 
expires and has to be looked up again. This allows institutions to change 
things. 
<P>The domain system is not limited to finding out Internet addresses. Each 
domain name is a node in a database. The node can have records that define a 
number of different properties. Examples are Internet address, computer type, 
and a list of services provided by a computer. A program can ask for a specific 
piece of information, or all information about a given name. It is possible for 
a node in the database to be marked as an "alias" (or nickname) for another 
node. It is also possible to use the domain system to store information about 
users, mailing lists, or other objects. 
<P>There is an Internet standard defining the operation of these databases, as 
well as the protocols used to make queries of them. Every network utility has to 
be able to make such queries, since this is now the official way to evaluate 
host names. Generally utilities will talk to a server on their own system. This 
server will take care of contacting the other servers for them. This keeps down 
the amount of code that has to be in each application program. 
<P>The domain system is particularly important for handling computer mail. There 
are entry types to define what computer handles mail for a given name, to 
specify where an individual is to receive mail, and to define mailing lists. 
<P>(See RFC's 882, 883, and 973 for specifications of the domain system. RFC 974 
defines the use of the domain system in sending mail.)
