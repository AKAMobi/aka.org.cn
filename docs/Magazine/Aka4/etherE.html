<P>There was a brief discussion earlier about what IP datagrams look like on an 
Ethernet. The discussion showed the Ethernet header and checksum. However it 
left one hole: It didn't say how to figure out what Ethernet address to use when 
you want to talk to a given Internet address. In fact, there is a separate 
protocol for this, called ARP ("address resolution protocol"). (Note by the way 
that ARP is not an IP protocol. That is, the ARP datagrams do not have IP 
headers.) Suppose you are on system 128.6.4.194 and you want to connect to 
system 128.6.4.7. Your system will first verify that 128.6.4.7 is on the same 
network, so it can talk directly via Ethernet. Then it will look up 128.6.4.7 in 
its ARP table, to see if it already knows the Ethernet address. If so, it will 
stick on an Ethernet header, and send the packet. But suppose this system is not 
in the ARP table. There is no way to send the packet, because you need the 
Ethernet address. So it uses the ARP protocol to send an ARP request. 
Essentially an ARP request says "I need the Ethernet address for 128.6.4.7". 
Every system listens to ARP requests. When a system sees an ARP request for 
itself, it is required to respond. So 128.6.4.7 will see the request, and will 
respond with an ARP reply saying in effect "128.6.4.7 is 8:0:20:1:56:34". 
(Recall that Ethernet addresses are 48 bits. This is 6 octets. Ethernet 
addresses are conventionally shown in hex, using the punctuation shown.) Your 
system will save this information in its ARP table, so future packets will go 
directly. Most systems treat the ARP table as a cache, and clear entries in it 
if they have not been used in a certain period of time. 
<P>Note by the way that ARP requests must be sent as "broadcasts". There is no 
way that an ARP request can be sent directly to the right system. After all, the 
whole reason for sending an ARP request is that you don't know the Ethernet 
address. So an Ethernet address of all ones is used, i.e. ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff. By 
convention, every machine on the Ethernet is required to pay attention to 
packets with this as an address. So every system sees every ARP requests. They 
all look to see whether the request is for their own address. If so, they 
respond. If not, they could just ignore it. (Some hosts will use ARP requests to 
update their knowledge about other hosts on the network, even if the request 
isn't for them.) Note that packets whose IP address indicates broadcast (e.g. 
255.255.255.255 or 128.6.4.255) are also sent with an Ethernet address that is 
all ones.
