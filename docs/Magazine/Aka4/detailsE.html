<P>As indicated earlier, Internet addresses are 32-bit numbers, normally written 
as 4 octets (in decimal), e.g. 128.6.4.7. There are actually 3 different types 
of address. The problem is that the address has to indicate both the network and 
the host within the network. It was felt that eventually there would be lots of 
networks. Many of them would be small, but probably 24 bits would be needed to 
represent all the IP networks. It was also felt that some very big networks 
might need 24 bits to represent all of their hosts. This would seem to lead to 
48 bit addresses. But the designers really wanted to use 32 bit addresses. So 
they adopted a kludge. The assumption is that most of the networks will be 
small. So they set up three different ranges of address. Addresses beginning 
with 1 to 126 use only the first octet for the network number. The other three 
octets are available for the host number. Thus 24 bits are available for hosts. 
These numbers are used for large networks. But there can only be 126 of these 
very big networks. The Arpanet is one, and there are a few large commercial 
networks. But few normal organizations get one of these "class A" addresses. For 
normal large organizations, "class B" addresses are used. Class B addresses use 
the first two octets for the network number. Thus network numbers are 128.1 
through 191.254. (We avoid 0 and 255, for reasons that we see below. We also 
avoid addresses beginning with 127, because that is used by some systems for 
special purposes.) The last two octets are available for host addesses, giving 
16 bits of host address. This allows for 64516 computers, which should be enough 
for most organizations. (It is possible to get more than one class B address, if 
you run out.) Finally, class C addresses use three octets, in the range 192.1.1 
to 223.254.254. These allow only 254 hosts on each network, but there can be 
lots of these networks. Addresses above 223 are reserved for future use, as 
class D and E (which are currently not defined). 
<P>Many large organizations find it convenient to divide their network number 
into "subnets". For example, Rutgers has been assigned a class B address, 128.6. 
We find it convenient to use the third octet of the address to indicate which 
Ethernet a host is on. This division has no significance outside of Rutgers. A 
computer at another institution would treat all datagrams addressed to 128.6 the 
same way. They would not look at the third octet of the address. Thus computers 
outside Rutgers would not have different routes for 128.6.4 or 128.6.5. But 
inside Rutgers, we treat 128.6.4 and 128.6.5 as separate networks. In effect, 
gateways inside Rutgers have separate entries for each Rutgers subnet, whereas 
gateways outside Rutgers just have one entry for 128.6. Note that we could do 
exactly the same thing by using a separate class C address for each Ethernet. As 
far as Rutgers is concerned, it would be just as convenient for us to have a 
number of class C addresses. However using class C addresses would make things 
inconvenient for the rest of the world. Every institution that wanted to talk to 
us would have to have a separate entry for each one of our networks. If every 
institution did this, there would be far too many networks for any reasonable 
gateway to keep track of. By subdividing a class B network, we hide our internal 
structure from everyone else, and save them trouble. This subnet strategy 
requires special provisions in the network software. It is described in RFC 950. 

<P>0 and 255 have special meanings. 0 is reserved for machines that don't know 
their address. In certain circumstances it is possible for a machine not to know 
the number of the network it is on, or even its own host address. For example, 
0.0.0.23 would be a machine that knew it was host number 23, but didn't know on 
what network. 
<P>255 is used for "broadcast". A broadcast is a message that you want every 
system on the network to see. Broadcasts are used in some situations where you 
don't know who to talk to. For example, suppose you need to look up a host name 
and get its Internet address. Sometimes you don't know the address of the 
nearest name server. In that case, you might send the request as a broadcast. 
There are also cases where a number of systems are interested in information. It 
is then less expensive to send a single broadcast than to send datagrams 
individually to each host that is interested in the information. In order to 
send a broadcast, you use an address that is made by using your network address, 
with all ones in the part of the address where the host number goes. For 
example, if you are on network 128.6.4, you would use 128.6.4.255 for 
broadcasts. How this is actually implemented depends upon the medium. It is not 
possible to send broadcasts on the Arpanet, or on point to point lines. However 
it is possible on an Ethernet. If you use an Ethernet address with all its bits 
on (all ones), every machine on the Ethernet is supposed to look at that 
datagram. 
<P>Although the official broadcast address for network 128.6.4 is now 
128.6.4.255, there are some other addresses that may be treated as broadcasts by 
certain implementations. For convenience, the standard also allows 
255.255.255.255 to be used. This refers to all hosts on the local network. It is 
often simpler to use 255.255.255.255 instead of finding out the network number 
for the local network and forming a broadcast address such as 128.6.4.255. In 
addition, certain older implementations may use 0 instead of 255 to form the 
broadcast address. Such implementations would use 128.6.4.0 instead of 
128.6.4.255 as the broadcast address on network 128.6.4. Finally, certain older 
implementations may not understand about subnets. Thus they consider the network 
number to be 128.6. In that case, they will assume a broadcast address of 
128.6.255.255 or 128.6.0.0. Until support for broadcasts is implemented 
properly, it can be a somewhat dangerous feature to use. 
<P>Because 0 and 255 are used for unknown and broadcast addresses, normal hosts 
should never be given addresses containing 0 or 255. Addresses should never 
begin with 0, 127, or any number above 223. Addresses violating these rules are 
sometimes referred to as "Martians", because of rumors that the Central 
University of Mars is using network 225. </BODY></HTML>
