<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Good project- and archive- naming practice</A></H2>

<P>As the load on maintainers of archives like Metalab, the PSA site and CPAN
increases, there is an increasing trend for submissions to be processed
partly or wholly by programs (rather than entirely by a human).
<P>This makes it more important for project and archive-file names to fit
regular patterns that computer programs can parse and understand.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Use GNU-style names with a stem and major.minor.patch numbering.</A>
</H2>

<P>It's helpful to everybody if your archive files all have GNU-like
names -- all-lower-case alphanumeric stem prefix, followed by a dash,
followed by a version number, extension, and other suffixes.
<P>Let's suppose you have a project you call `foobar' at version 1,
release 2, level 3.  If it's got just one archive part (presumably the
sources), here's what its names should look
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>foobar-1.2.3.tar.gz</B><DD><P>The source archive
<P>
<DT><B>foobar.lsm</B><DD><P>The LSM file (assuming you're submitting to Metalab).
<P>
</DL>
<P>Please <EM>don't</EM> use these:
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>foobar123.tar.gz</B><DD><P>This looks to many programs like an archive
for a project called`foobar123' with no version number.
<P>
<DT><B>foobar1.2.3.tar.gz</B><DD><P>This looks to many programs like an archive
for a project called `foobar1' at version 2.3.
<P>
<DT><B>foobar-v1.2.3.tar.gz</B><DD><P>Many programs think this goes with a
project called `foobar-v1'.
<P>
<DT><B>foo_bar-1.2.3.tar.gz</B><DD><P>The underscore is hard for people to speak,
type, and remember
<P>
<DT><B>FooBar-1.2.3.tar.gz</B><DD><P>Unless you <EM>like</EM> looking like a
marketing weenie.  This is also hard for people to speak, type, and remember.
</DL>
<P>If you have to differentiate between source and binary archives, or
between different kinds of binary, or express some kind of build
option in the file name, please treat that as a file extension to go
<EM>after</EM> the version number. That is, please do this:
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>foobar-1.2.3.src.tar.gz            </B><DD><P>sources
<P>
<DT><B>foobar-1.2.3.bin.tar.gz            </B><DD><P>binaries, type not specified
<P>
<DT><B>foobar-1.2.3.bin.ELF.tar.gz        </B><DD><P>ELF binaries
<P>
<DT><B>foobar-1.2.3.bin.ELF.static.tar.gz </B><DD><P>ELF binaries statically linked 
<P>
<DT><B>foobar-1.2.3.bin.SPARC.tar.gz      </B><DD><P>SPARC binaries
</DL>
<P>Please <EM>don't</EM> use names like `foobar-ELF-1.2.3.tar.gz', because
programs have a hard time telling type infixes (like `-ELF') from the
stem.
<P>A good general form of name has these parts in order:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>project prefix</LI>
<LI>dash</LI>
<LI>version number</LI>
<LI>dot</LI>
<LI>"src" or "bin" (optional)</LI>
<LI>dot or dash (dot preferred)</LI>
<LI>binary type and options (optional)</LI>
<LI>archiving and compression extensions</LI>
</OL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 But respect local conventions where appropriate</A>
</H2>

<P>Some projects and communities have well-defined conventions for names and
version numbers that aren't necessarily compatible with the above advice.
For instance, Apache modules are generally named like mod_foo, and have
both their own version number and the version of Apache with which they
work.  Likewise, Perl modules have version numbers that can be treated as
floating point numbers (e.g., you might see 1.303 rather than 1.3.3), and
the distributions are generally named Foo-Bar-1.303.tar.gz for version
1.303 of module Foo::Bar.
<P>Look for and respect the conventions of specialized
communities and developers; for general use, follow the above
guidelines.
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Try hard to choose a name prefix that is unique and easy to type</A>
</H2>

<P>The stem prefix should be common to all a project's files, and it
should be easy to read, type, and remember.  So please don't use
underscores.  And don't capitalize or BiCapitalize without extremely
good reason -- it messes up the natural human-eyeball search order and
looks like some marketing weenie trying to be clever.
<P>It confuses people when two different projects have the same stem name.
So try to check for collisions before your first release.  A good place
to check is the
