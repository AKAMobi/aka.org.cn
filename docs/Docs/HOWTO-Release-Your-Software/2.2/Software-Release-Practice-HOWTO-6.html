<H2><A NAME="s6">6. Good distribution-making practice</A></H2>

<P>These guidelines describe how your distribution should look when someone
downloads, retrieves and unpacks it.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Make sure tarballs always unpack into a single new directory</A>
</H2>

<P>The single most annoying mistake newbie developers make is to build
tarballs that unpack the files and directories in the distribution into
the current directory, potentially stepping on files already located there.
<EM>Never do this!</EM>
<P>Instead, make sure your archive files all have a common directory part
named after the project, so they will unpack into a single top-level 
directory directly <EM>beneath</EM> the current one.
<P>Here's a makefile trick that, assuming your distribution directory is
named `foobar' and SRC contains a list of your distribution files,
accomplishes this.  It requires GNU tar 1.13
<P>
<PRE>
VERS=1.0
foobar-$(VERS).tar.gz:
        tar --name-prefix='foobar-$(VERS)/' -czf foobar-$(VERS).tar.gz $(SRC)
</PRE>
<P>If you have an older tar program, do something like this:
<P>
<PRE>
foobar-$(VERS).tar.gz:
        @ls $(SRC) | sed s:^:foobar-$(VERS)/: >MANIFEST
        @(cd ..; ln -s foobar foobar-$(VERS))
        (cd ..; tar -czvf foobar/foobar-$(VERS).tar.gz `cat foobar/MANIFEST`)
        @(cd ..; rm foobar-$(VERS))
</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 Have a README</A>
</H2>

<P>Have a file called README or READ.ME that is a roadmap of your source
distribution.  By ancient convention, this is the first file intrepid
explorers will read after unpacking the source.
<P>Good things to have in the README include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>A brief description of the project.</LI>
<LI>A pointer to the project website (if it has one)</LI>
<LI>Notes on the developer's build environment and potential portability
problems.</LI>
<LI>A roadmap describing important files and subdirectories. </LI>
<LI>Either build/installation instructions or a pointer to a file
containing same (usually INSTALL).</LI>
<LI>Either a maintainers/credits list or a pointer to a file containing
same (usually CREDITS). </LI>
<LI>Either recent project news or a pointer to a file containing same
(usually NEWS). </LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 Respect and follow standard file naming practices</A>
</H2>

<P>Before even looking at the README, your intrepid explorer will have scanned
the filenames in the top-level directory of your unpacked distribution.
Those names can themselves convey information.  By adhering to certain
standard naming practices, you can give the explorer valuable clues
about what to look in next.
<P>Here are some standard top-level file names and what they mean.  Not
every distribution needs all of these.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>README or READ.ME</B><DD><P>the roadmap file, to be read first
<P>
<DT><B>INSTALL</B><DD><P>configuration, build, and installation instructions
<P>
<DT><B>CREDITS</B><DD><P>list of project contributers
<P>
<DT><B>NEWS</B><DD><P>recent project news
<P>
<DT><B>HISTORY</B><DD><P>project history
<P>
<DT><B>COPYING</B><DD><P>project license terms (GNU convention)
<P>
<DT><B>LICENSE</B><DD><P>project license terms
<P>
<DT><B>MANIFEST</B><DD><P>list of files in the distribution
<P>
<DT><B>FAQ</B><DD><P>plain-text Frequently-Asked-Questions document for the project 
<P>
<DT><B>TAGS</B><DD><P>generated tag file for use by Emacs or vi
</DL>
<P>Note the overall convention that filenames with all-caps names are
human-readable metainformation about the package, rather than build
components.
<P>Having a FAQ can save you a lot of grief.  When a question about the
project comes up often, put it in the FAQ; then direct users to read the
FAQ before sending questions or bug reports.  A well-nurtured FAQ can
decrease the support burden on the project maintainers by an order of
magnitude or more.
<P>Having a HISTORY or NEWS file with timestamps in it for each release
is valuable.  Among other things, it may help establish prior art if
you are ever hit with a patent-infringement lawsuit (this hasn't
happened to anyone yet, but best to be prepared).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4 Provide RPMs</A>
</H2>

<P>The de-facto standard format for installable binary packages is that used
by the Red Hat Package manager, RPM.  It's featured in the most popular
Linux distribution, and supported by effectively all other Linux
distributions (except Debian and Slackware; and Debian can install from
RPMs).
<P>Accordingly, it's a good idea for your project site to provide installable 
RPMs as well as source tarballs.
<P>It's also a good idea for you to include in your source tarball the RPM
spec file, with a production that makes RPMs from it in your Makefile.
The spec file should have the extension `.spec'; that's how the rpm -t
option finds it in a tarball.
<P>For extra style points, generate your spec file with a shellscript that
automatically plugs in the correct version number by analyzing the Makefile
or a version.h.
