</H2>

<P>There is a large body of good-practice traditions for open-source code that
helps other people port, use, and cooperate with developing it.  Some of these
conventions are traditional in the Unix world and predate Linux; others
have developed recently in response to particular new tools and technologies
such as the World Wide Web.
<P>This document will help you learn good practice.  It is organized into
topic sections, each containing a series of checklist items.  Think of
these as a pre-flight checklist for your distribution.
