<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Good licensing and copyright practice: the practice</A></H2>

<P>Here's how to translate the theory above into practice:
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Make yourself or the FSF the copyright holder</A>
</H2>

<P>In some cases, if you have a sponsoring organization behind you with
lawyers, you might wish to give copyright to that organization.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Use a license conformant to the Open Source Definition</A>
</H2>

<P>The Open Source Definition is the community gold standard for licenses.
The OSD is not a license itself; rather, it defines a minimum set of rights
that a license must guarantee in order to be considered an open-source
license.  The OSD, and supporting materials, may be found at the web site
of the 
<A HREF="http://www.opensource.org">Open Source Initiative</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Don't write your own license if you can possibly avoid it.</A>
</H2>

<P>The widely-known OSD-conformant licenses have well-established interpretive
traditions.  Developers (and, to the extent they care, users) know what
they imply, and have a reasonable take on the risks and tradeoffs they
involve.  Therefore, use one of the standard licenses carried on the OSI
site if at all possible.
<P>If you must write your own license, be sure to have it certified by OSI.  This
will avoid a lot of argument and overhead.  Unless you've been through it, 
you have no idea how nasty a licensing flamewar can get; people become
passionate because the licenses are regarded as almost-sacred covenants
touching the core values of the open-source community.
<P>Furthermore, the presence of an established interpretive tradition may
prove important if your license is ever tested in court.  At time of 
writing (late 1999) there is no case law either supporting or invalidating
any open-source license.  However, it is a legal doctrine (at least in
the U.S., and probably in other common-law countries such as England
and the rest of the British Commonwealth) that courts are supposed to 
interpret licenses and contracts according to the expectations and
practices of the community in which they originated.
