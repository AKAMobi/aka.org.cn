<h1>What is virtual server?</h1>

<p>Virtual server is a scalable <font face="Times New Roman">and
highly available </font>server built on a cluster of real
servers. The architecture of the cluster is transparent to end
users, and the users see only a single virtual server. Please
consider the following figure,</p>

<p>The real servers may be interconnected by high-speed LAN or by
geographically dispersed WAN. The front-end of the real servers
is a load balancer, which schedules requests to the different
servers and make parallel services of the cluster to appear as a
virtual service on a single IP address. Scalability is achieved
by transparently adding or removing a node in the cluster. High
availability is provided by detecting node or daemon failures and
reconfiguring the system appropriately.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>The basic goal of the Linux Virtual Server Project is to:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><em>Produce a high-performance and highly available server
    for Linux based on clustering, which provides a good
    scalability, reliability and serviceability.</em></p>
