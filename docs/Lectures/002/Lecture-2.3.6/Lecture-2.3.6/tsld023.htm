 <H1>Linux Design Principle</H1> 
 <P><UL>
<LI><H2>Managing the development of Linux and making design decisions about Linux dictate the same approach.
</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Portability
<BR>Compile time constant rather than using a variable
<BR>The generalizations you're looking for when surveying systems are frequently the same as the optimizations you'd like to make to improve the kernel's performance. 
<BR>If you had not been thinking about portability as a design goal, but had just been thinking about optimization of the kernel on a particular architecture, you would frequently reach the same conclusion.
<LI>Modularity
<BR>Virtual FS, MM, Scheduler 
<BR>Module: kernel modules to keep hardware specifics in the modules. This is a good middle ground between putting all the hardware specifics in the core kernel, which makes for a fast but unportable kernel, and putting all the hardware specifics in user space, which results in a system that is either slow, unstable, or both.</UL></UL></P>
