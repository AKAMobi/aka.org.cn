<H2><A NAME="s7">7. Good communication practice</A></H2>

<P>Your software won't do the world much good if nobody but you knows it
exists.  Also, developing a visible presence for the project on the
Internet will assist you in recruiting users and co-developers.  Here
are the standard ways to do that.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 Announce to c.o.l.a</A>
</H2>

<P>Announce new releases to 
<A HREF="news:comp.os.linux.announce">comp.os.linux.announce</A>.  Besides being widely read itself,
this group is a major feeder for web-based what's-new sites like
<A HREF="http://www.freshmeat.net">Freshmeat</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 Announce to a relevant topic newsgroup</A>
</H2>

<P>Find USENET topics group directly relevant to your application, 
and announce there as well.  Post only where the <EM>function</EM> of the
code is relevant, and exercise restraint.
<P>If (for example) you are releasing a program written in Perl that queries
IMAP servers, you should certainly post to comp.mail.imap.  But you
should probably not post to comp.lang.perl unless the program is also
an instructive example of cutting-edge Perl techniques.
<P>Your announcement should include the URL of a project website.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.3">7.3 Have a website</A>
</H2>

<P>If you intend try to build any substantial user or developer community
around your project, it should have a website.  Standard things to have
on the website include:
<UL>
<LI>The project charter (why it exists, who the audience is, etc).</LI>
<LI>Download links for the project sources.</LI>
<LI>Instructions on how to join the project mailing list(s).</LI>
<LI>A FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) list.</LI>
<LI>HTMLized versions of the project documentation</LI>
<LI>Links to related and/or competing projects.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Some project sites even have URLs for anonymous access to the master
source tree.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.4">7.4 Host project mailing lists</A>
</H2>

<P>It's standard practice to have a private development list through which project
collaborators can communicate and exchange patches.  You may also
want to have an announcements list for people who want to be kept informed
of the project's process
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.5">7.5 Release to major archives</A>
</H2>

<P>For the last several years, the 
<A HREF="http://www.metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/">Metalab archive</A> has
been the most important interchange location for Linux software.
<P>Other important locations include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>the 
<A HREF="http://www.python.org">Python Software Activity</A>
site (for software written in Python).</LI>
<LI>the 
<A HREF="http://language.perl.com/CPAN">CPAN</A>, the
Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, (for software written in Perl).</LI>
</UL>
