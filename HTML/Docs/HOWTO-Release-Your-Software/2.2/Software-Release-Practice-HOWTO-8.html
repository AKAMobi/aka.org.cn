<P>Managing a project well when all the participants are volunteers presents
some unique challenges.  This is too large a topic to cover in a HOWTO.
Fortunately, there are some useful white papers available that will help you
understand the major issues.
<P>For discussion of basic development organization and the 
release-early-release-often `bazaar mode', see 
<A HREF="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/">The Cathedral and the Bazaar</A>.
<P>For discussion of motivational psychology, community customs, and conflict
resolution, see
<A HREF="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/homesteading/">Homesteading the Noosphere</A>.
<P>For discussion of economics and appropriate business models, see 
<A HREF="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/magic-cauldron/">The Magic Cauldron</A>.
<P>These papers are not the last word on open-source development.  But they
were the first serious analyses to be written, and have yet to be
superseded.
