>Most of these are concerned with ensuring portability, not only across
Linuxes but to other Unixes as well.  Being portable to other Unixes 
is not just a worthy form of professionalism and hackerly politeness, 
it's valuable insurance against future changes in Linux itself.</P
><P
>Finally, other people <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>will</I
> try to build
your code on non-Linux systems; portability minimizes the number of
annoying perplexed email messages you will get.</P

>5.1. Write either pure ANSI C or a portable scripting language</A
></H2
><P
>For portability and stability, you should write either in ANSI C or a
scripting language that is guaranteed portable because it has just one
cross-platform implementation.</P
><P
>Scripting languages that qualify include Python, Perl, Tcl,
Emacs Lisp, and PHP.  Plain old shell does <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>not</I
>
qualify; there are too many different implementations with subtle
idiosyncracies, and the shell environment is subject to disruption by
user customizations such as shell aliases.</P
><P
>Java holds promise as a portable language, but the Linux-available 
implementations are still scratchy and poorly integrated with Linux.
Java is still a bleeding-edge choice, though one likely to become more
popular as it matures.</P

>5.2. Follow good C portability practices</A
></H2
><P
>If you are writing C, do feel free to use the full ANSI features --
including function prototypes, which will help you spot cross-module
inconsistancies.  The old-style K&#38;R compilers are history.</P
><P
>On the other hand, do <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>not</I
> assume that GCC-specific 
features such as the `-pipe' option or nested functions are available.
These will come around and bite you the second somebody ports to a
non-Linux, non-GCC system.</P

></H2

>If you're writing C, use autoconf/automake/autoheader to handle
portability issues, do system-configuration probes, and tailor your
makefiles.  People building from sources today expect to be able to
type "configure; make" and get a clean build -- and rightly so.</P

>If you're writing C, test-compile with -Wall and clean up the
errors at least once before each release.  This catches a surprising
number of errors.  For real thoroughness, compile with -pedantic as
well.</P

>If you're writing Perl, check your code with perl -c (and maybe
-T, if applicable).  Use perl -w and 'use strict' religiously.  (See
the Perl documentation for discussion.)</P
