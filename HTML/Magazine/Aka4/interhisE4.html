<p>
<P>Copyright 1993 Lauren P. Burka 
<P>In August of 1989, a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University wrote a 
game in a weekend that he called TinyMUD. It was a 
simple, user-extensible multi-user game that was available to anyone on the 
internet who knew the address and port number (lancelot.avalon.cs.cmu.edu 
4201). While TinyMUD wasn't the first MUD , its ease of use 
and portability to many Unix systems caused an explosion of MUD popularity that 
hasn't yet waned. Now MUDs are at a port near you, in the  or 
the <I>New York Times</I>.
<P>MUDs (multi-user dungeons or dimensions) have most of 
the following characteristics: several people can play at once; the game is 
partioned into virtual spaces ("rooms") such that people and objects in one room 
cannot directly interact with people and objects in another room; all 
interaction takes place in text, not pictures or sounds; communications are 
handled with TCP sockets; most of the code is written and maintained by 
university students and is available in the public domain; combinations of 
objects, rooms and exits allow simple puzzles, while some MUDs with their own 
programming languages allow for much more complicated puzzles and toys; even 
MUDs created for serious purposes retain some of the original Adventure or 
role-playing game atmosphere; and since identities aren't constrained by 
reality, the characters on muds include close facsimiles of the people who play 
them, furry animals, science fiction heros, and all ranges of cute, profane, 
obnoxious, witty, or just plain weird.
<P>Jim Aspnes (now an instructor at Yale) thought that TinyMUD was just a 
weekend hack that would lose novelty quickly. He 
made several decisions, or non-decisions, that contributed to both the coolness 
and the problems of MUDing.
<P>
<H2>The Process from Hell: Memory vs. Disk-based MUDS.</H2>
<P>Earlier MUDs tended to retain most of the game database on disk. Rooms and 
objects were fetched from disk as players needed them. This was slow.
<P>TinyMUD retained the entire database in memory. This design assumed that the 
database wouldn't grow particularly large. In fact, for small MUDs, a 
memory-based database is much faster. It is obvious that after the database 
grows large enough, the process will begin to swap heavily. The machine load 
will climb as pagefaults collect. Most architectures have a process size limit. 
Aspnes finally abandoned TinyMUD when it crashed on reaching the 32 megabyte 
process size limit on his machine. The 
database bloat problem is exacerbated by MUDs with their own programming 
languages, leading to huge individual objects and even background processes. 
LambdaMOO, running at Xerox Parc on a SparcCenter 1000, constitutes a 198 
megabyte process for a database that takes 80 megabytes on disk as of March 
1994.
<P>The performance problems of very large memory-based muds is well known, but 
in spite of a substantial pool of talented MUD programmers, improvements to 
database layers are not considered until it's too late. There are several 
reasons for this:
<P>Ignorance. Many students know C, but few MUDers have made a study of database 
design. I recall an argument on the newsgroup rec.games.mud where a student 
insisted, presumably with a straight face, that disk-based MUDs couldn't 
possibly work because they would wear out the disk (The student in question was 
ripped to rhetorical shreds by a sarcastic Marcus J. Ranum. If you don't know 
who he is, don't worry about it).
<P>Habit. There have been a couple of MUDs with disk-based database layer. They 
include UberMUD and UnterMUD by Marcus Ranum (then an employee of DEC) and 
Andrew Molitor (grad student at Wesleyan University), and TeenyMUD, a project of 
Andrew Molitor's. UberMUD, which used a b+ tree, proved far too complicated to 
interest most MUDers (thought it allowed for building some really neat toys)  
UnterMUD used hash tables, with database access speeds improved by clever 
caching. 
It was used in some production MUDs, but the database layer didn't allow some 
MUDer favorites, such as checking the total number of database objects. The 
UnterMUD database layer or caching scheme have been put to work in other 
servers, notably MUSH 2.0. 
<P>There is at least one long-running TeenyMUD. TeenyMUD uses a flat-file with a 
direct index, about as efficient as a hash table, though with less sophisticated 
caching than Unter or Uber. It has an attractively low use of resources, and is 
recommended for people who just want to try out running a MUD for a week. 
However, MUDers who are interested in toys and gadgets tend to overlook it 
because of its lack of a programming language. Needless to say, if your server 
is entirely memory-based, and your mud process just grew large enough to make 
disk-basing attractive, it's too late to switch servers without discarding your 
database.
<P>Lameness. Enough said.
<P>Disk-basing is not a magic solution. It complicates checkpointing (making 
backups while the server is running). A further technical issue is that a 
disk-based database layer may not improve performance if the database is large 
enough. In theory, a cache of frequently-visited objects will be retained in 
memory, and objects will be swapped in as they are referenced. Since objects 
cannot be grouped on database pages by geographical proximity, any activity that 
visits a large number of objects in sequence will cause the process to thrash. 
Since the operating system knows how to swap better than most applications, a 
disk-based database will be less happy than a memory-based one. Disk-basing will 
still place a comfortable upper bound on database growth, though the disk image 
will grow larger, uglier, and more fragmented.
<P>Rather than resort to a complex software solution for database growth, many 
MUDs rely on social restrictions on building, or an occasional rm -rf and a 
fresh start with a new database. Unfortunately, one of the signs and 
side-effects of a successful MUD is growth, both in size and population. A MUD 
where players can't build, or where what they build won't stay, occasions far 
less feeling of community investment or belonging than a community would desire.
<P>It should be noted that disk, memory, and cpu are the only significant drains 
on system resources. A MUD with fifty users still consumes a fraction of the net 
bandwidth of an FTP session and won't slow communications noticibly.
<P>Between 1989 and 1994, the memory and cpu power of the average Internet host 
has increased by one or maybe two orders of magnitude. In 1989, however, only a 
very few people had access to an Internet host with extra cpu cycles to devote 
to a MUD, especially one that might dominate an entire workstation so that no 
other processes could hope to run with reasonable response time.
<P>Meanwhile the number of university students MUDing increased exponentially as 
MUDers introduced their friends to the new game, but cpu cycles devoted to 
MUDing increased only slowly. There were two upshots of this disparity.
<P>People began running MUDs anywhere they could, often without asking the 
permission of the machine administrators. In 1990, someone using the GNU cluster 
would often find four or five MUDs running on one machine, all of which would 
have to be killed before a user could do real work.
<P>People who controlled the resources to run a MUD gained an enormous amount of 
power over a growing virtual community, often well out of proportion to the 
amount of time and emotional energy they devoted to developing the MUD. 
<P>This brings us to the second big category of MUD issues.
<P>
<H2>Whose game is this anyway?</H2>
<P>Aspnes thought that his game would last for a couple of weeks before people 
got bored. When they didn't, and he kept it running, many players chose to 
believe that TinyMUD, and their investment in building, would last indefinitely 
(or at least until they graduated and lost net access). Meanwhile, Aspnes, the 
wizard, put less time into administering TinyMUD as it grew larger and harder to 
control, both in resource usage and in the behavior of the participants.
<P>TinyMUD's restriction on the number of objects a player can build was a 
simple monetary system. Pennies were required to build rooms and objects. A 
player started with no pennies, and would gain some by visiting other peoples' 
building and finding treasures. Ambitious builders rapidly discovered that the 
penny system could be circumvented with macros to repeatedly grab valuable 
treasures. This was good for people with ambitious building projects, but 
enabled other people to, for instance, create 500 objects called "You found a 
penny!" and leave them in the Town Square so that anyone walking through was 
forced to watch all 500 objects scroll past. Once these objects were removed, 
they still added to database bloat until someone invented a working recycle 
command.
<P>Parts of TinyMUD extended in linear fashion with street and subway metaphors. 
Parts of it sprawled and tangled. There were teleport booths linking regions in 
five or more dimensions. The steam tunnels in Wesleyan University connected to a 
University of Florida Campus. Taiwan was right next to Cambridge. There were 
self-contained puzzles, including a replica of Adventure in the Colossal Cave. 
There were hangouts, or, more precisely, a hangout.
<P>The Rec Room was an early piece of the database. It had some toys and 
scenery. The Rec Room's owner left it linkable and provided free exits outwards 
for builders. Therefore anyone who had just built something made the entrance 
and exit connect to the Rec Room instead of a linear part of the database. Soon 
the Rec Room became the place to be, but also the main traffic nexus.
<P>Meanwhile, a smaller proportion of MUDers were building (just as well for 
database bloat) and fewer were exploring. More people were treating TinyMUD as a 
chat system with furniture. There was a great deal of discussion about trying to 
encourage, or even force, players to explore. However, hanging out soon came to 
be accepted as just a vital part of MUDing as building and exploring. Most 
servers provide systems of conversation utilities as complex as anything 
provided for building.
<P>The concentration of people in one virtual room meant that anyone who wished 
to cause trouble could write a program to connect to the MUD, find that one 
room, and spew volumes of text. The MUD would become unplayable.
<P>In response to TinyMUD's perceived shortcomings, MUDers who had the 
resources, or could beg them of someone else, started new MUDs. These MUDs often 
had some central planning involved in building, or at least restrictions on who 
could put what where. All of them had more active wizards. Building restrictions 
led to squabbles, occasionally quite emphatic and bitter. Builders might see 
their masterworks recycled by wizards who wanted to cut down on database 
swapping. The "Rec Room phenomenon" elevated people who owned popular spaces to 
de-facto wizard status due to their ability to control who could enter or link 
new building to public space. These people wielded power unequalled by anyone 
except the site administrator.
<P>MUDers were largely college students who had just discovered concepts like 
"freedom of speech" and "artistic expression" and vigorously, if ineffectually, 
attempted to apply these ideas to items in a shared database. The next stage for 
MUD conflict was set and still hasn't been resolved.
<P>Who owns a MUD database? The site administrator? The wizards (people with 
programming and administrative privileges on the MUD)? The builders who 
contributed sweat to create the landscape?
<P>A database is just a file. What happens if you copy it? Who owns the copies? 
What if there are two copies of the same database running on different machines?
<P>If the policies of the MUD or site administration change, can builders who 
disapprove destroy their building? If they don't, is this a sign that they 
approve of the new administration? What if their building constitutes a "public" 
area or vital topological interlink?
<P>Do players have the right to participate in a MUD? Do they have a right to 
build? Are restrictions on who can participate fair? Do players with an 
investment in building have a say in the fate of a database? Can it be 
decommissioned over their protests?
<P>Distributed MUDing, (like distributed almost-everything) has been proposed as 
a solution to database ownership issues and all other social ills of MUDs. There 
even have been some moderately successful distributed MUD experiments. In 
theory, each builder could maintain a MUD process on their own machines, with 
their own building. Players can walk from MUD to MUD seamlessly. If a 
disagreement results, people can easily "take their toys and go home." However, 
distributed MUDs never quite caught on.
<P>It should be intuitively obvious that if the problem of user authentication 
hasn't been solved for systems, there are no satisfactory solutions for a 
user-level process. A MUD administrator may choose to trust a couple of host 
MUDs, but if one of those has somewhat lax security, they could allow 
troublemakers excluded from one MUD to log on to another and walk over.
<P>Furthermore, a distributed MUD system requires each participating MUD to use 
the same server code, or at least the same database layer. I am not aware of any 
satisfactory solution to the problem of porting objects carried by players from 
one MUD to another, especially as objects with code attached can present nasty 
security holes.
<P>
<H2>"Do what thou wilt, that shall be the whole of the law."</H2>
<P>As any site administrator knows, people aren't any more reasonable with 
shared computer resources than they are with shared real-life resources. In the 
absence of an active administrator, the original TinyMUD database grew not only 
larger but messier. The net contains its share of young, under-socialized people 
who would rather break other peoples' toys than build their own, and can cause 
havoc with a few simple programming tools. The problems can be worse on MUDs 
because of the relative anonymity available even to people with no skills at 
evading net security. 
<P>MUDs are games, but it is generally agreed by most administrators and players 
that MUDing should be fun, and for most people, the receiving end of harassment 
is not a fun place to be. But the questions of what constitutes harassment are 
more painful than any of the programming issues involved. Are gestures of 
violence or obscenity protected speech or artistic expression, or an upsetting 
nuissance for more placid MUDers? Does playing a role entitle a player to be 
rude or aggressive?
<P>Coercing players to adhere to social norms does little good when there are no 
social norms. On a MUD geography, gender, ethnicity, status, and even gravity 
aren't what they seem to be. One can well understand the confusion that results 
when characters who are blue, furry, or who can fly insist that newcomers behave 
as they would in real life. Furthermore, a social norm would assume the 
existance of a society. A bunch of students taking study breaks have other 
things on their minds than evolving codes of ethics.
<P>Whether or not MUDs are societies, they generate governments the way mud 
puddles were once assumed to generate worms. Traditionally there have been three 
different approaches towards MUD administration.
<P>There is the Jim Aspnes "leave it alone" method. MUDs tend to grow unruly 
quickly with no one to boot troublemakers. In the absence of an active 
administrator, most MUD communities evolve a form of vigilante justice utilizing 
powerful MUD client software. Defensive capabilities include suppressing output 
from problem players. As for offensive strategies, it is possible to chase 
almost anyone away by quoting /usr/dict/words at them, especially if their 
client isn't as powerful as yours.
<P>On the other hand, some MUDs make a virtue of neglect by forming a community 
where obnoxious behavior is the norm, and the central form of interaction is the 
TinyMUD "kill" command.
Catharsis is a well-known use of the virtual realm, and with a little work, 
obscenity can be raised to an art form.
<P>Some MUDs adopt more autocratic management style. This works best if the 
person who administers the machine is also the head MUD wizard, and plays often 
enough to know the players and to spot developing problems. Most such MUDs also 
utilize a form of registration for players, so that anyone playing must have at 
least a valid return address, and troublemakers can be permanently toaded.
The biggest bug in this system is that an autocratic MUD will tend to collect 
only people who like, or at least tolerate, the head wizard. A more subtle 
problem is that the administrative load of fielding user complaints, registering 
new players, and catching flack from users who contest trivial decisions 
converts even the most congenial people into advanced cases of burn-out, an 
unacceptable cost for a leisure-time activity. 
<P>The third option is to evolve a collective MUD administration out of the most 
capable players. It has been humorously remarked that while adventure gaming 
muds allowed players to gain levels through solving puzzles and killing monsters 
until they reached wizardhood and got to build, TinyMUDs and their cousins have 
a similar form of ranking where players gain points by hanging out with the 
wizards until they become wizards too. Some of the longest-running MUDs have 
utilized a collective administration, often controlled by voting. These MUDs 
evolve convoluted or even vicious politics while wizards and players split into 
factions and accuse each other of gross improprieties in public fora such as 
USENET.
<P>On the other hand, politics are an inevitable part of real life. Some players 
may consider politics fun, while others regard them with abject horror. The 
Internet is growing ever more populated, and the blissful anarchy of earlier 
days may give way to something more complex and sustainable.
<P>
<H2>Conclusions: "You can't solve social problems in software."</H2>
<P>Years ago system administrators were chasing unwanted MUDs off their systems. 
Now administrators are taking a second look. MUDs offer clear advantages over 
mailing lists for connecting geographically disparate project members, keeping 
students on co-op assignments in touch with friends and advisors, and granting 
disabled students full access to the community. MUDs enable students to talk 
real-time with students at other institutions, and cut down on the isolation 
inherent to a suburban university. A virtual model of an institution allows 
virtual tours for prospective students, employees, and contributors.
<P>It is clear that further software development is a necessary precursor 
towards forming stable MUD communities. Virtual communities are as stressed by 
scarce resources as are real life communities, and knowing that a MUD database 
will be thrown away as soon as the server exceeds process size or the system 
software becomes obsolete suppresses building and other acts of community 
investment.
<P>Even with improvements to server software, the social problems of living in a 
text-based virtual community have changed little in five years. Friction will 
persist even after the stresses of limited resources are removed. 
<P>There has been mainstream media attention to "social problems" on MUDs (this 
is unsurprising; sex and death in cyberspace sell more papers than database 
layer debates do). But if would-be MUD administrators think that virtual rape 
and MUD addiction are the only issues they face, they will be surprised.
<P>Should MUDs be anonymous, or should MUD ID's correspond to real-life contact 
information? Anonymity may facilitate anti-social behavior, but registered 
identities remove one of a MUD's most useful features: a veil for the shy. A 
compromise is to restrict access to identity information to the MUD 
administrators, but anything saved in a file is not as secret as one would wish.
<P>Who gets to build? Restricting building to a particular theme or layout 
excludes people with different ideas, but uncontrolled building makes it 
impossible to to locate anything or explore the database. A bloated MUD is no 
fun for anyone.
<P>Who educates new users? Should abusive users be punished on the MUD, or will 
there be real-life consequences? Can you know anyone's real-life identity for 
sure? Transplanting your institution's code of behavior to a virtual environment 
will not work. Notions of "property" and "person" that apply in real life may 
not in virtual life. Text interaction is simpler than real-life interaction, 
except that without tone and expression, it may be impossible to tell what 
effect words have on another person. If one user bombards another with random 
messages so that she or he is unable to use the MUD, has the offender committed 
an act of insult, assault, or social inconvenience?
<P>Even simple issues, like namespace management, can defy an easy answer. How 
many people named Dave can one mud support? Will assigning unique alpha-numeric 
user ID's to players kill the social atmosphere?
<P>A little thought will suffice to show that every social problem cannot be 
addressed by a code patch. An administrator of a MUD for college undergraduate 
students might be tempted to install filters to suppress certain words. Students 
will discover new ways to insult each other faster than the server can be 
hard-coded for politeness. Since some people can be driven to tears with a few 
simple English words, speech of any sort would become impossible in short order.
<P>MUD administrators who ignore these issues will find themselves making up 
rules on the fly at every incident. On the other hand, the social conditions 
that make rules work will change much faster on a MUD than in real life.
<P>"We, the MUDers of the world, in order to form a more perfect database, 
establish connectivity, insure the availability of the kill command to the 
competent, provide for a backup MUD in the case of net death, promote the 
proliferation of clues and secure a site for ourselves and our posterity, do 
ordain and establish this Constitution of Virtual States of Reality."
