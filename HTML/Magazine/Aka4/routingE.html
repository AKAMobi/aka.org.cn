<P>The description above indicated that the IP implementation is responsible for 
getting datagrams to the destination indicated by the destination address, but 
little was said about how this would be done. The task of finding how to get a 
datagram to its destination is referred to as "routing". In fact many of the 
details depend upon the particular implementation. However some general things 
can be said. 
<P>First, it is necessary to understand the model on which IP is based. IP 
assumes that a system is attached to some local network. We assume that the 
system can send datagrams to any other system on its own network. (In the case 
of Ethernet, it simply finds the Ethernet address of the destination system, and 
puts the datagram out on the Ethernet.) The problem comes when a system is asked 
to send a datagram to a system on a different network. This problem is handled 
by gateways. A gateway is a system that connects a network with one or more 
other networks. Gateways are often normal computers that happen to have more 
than one network interface. For example, we have a Unix machine that has two 
different Ethernet interfaces. Thus it is connected to networks 128.6.4 and 
128.6.3. This machine can act as a gateway between those two networks. The 
software on that machine must be set up so that it will forward datagrams from 
one network to the other. That is, if a machine on network 128.6.4 sends a 
datagram to the gateway, and the datagram is addressed to a machine on network 
128.6.3, the gateway will forward the datagram to the destination. Major 
communications centers often have gateways that connect a number of different 
networks. (In many cases, special-purpose gateway systems provide better 
performance or reliability than general-purpose systems acting as gateways. A 
number of vendors sell such systems.) 
<P>Routing in IP is based entirely upon the network number of the destination 
address. Each computer has a table of network numbers. For each network number, 
a gateway is listed. This is the gateway to be used to get to that network. Note 
that the gateway doesn't have to connect directly to the network. It just has to 
be the best place to go to get there. For example at Rutgers, our interface to 
NSFnet is at the John von Neuman Supercomputer Center (JvNC). Our connection to 
JvNC is via a high-speed serial line connected to a gateway whose address is 
128.6.3.12. Systems on net 128.6.3 will list 128.6.3.12 as the gateway for many 
off-campus networks. However systems on net 128.6.4 will list 128.6.4.1 as the 
gateway to those same off-campus networks. 128.6.4.1 is the gateway between 
networks 128.6.4 and 128.6.3, so it is the first step in getting to JvNC. 
<P>When a computer wants to send a datagram, it first checks to see if the 
destination address is on the system's own local network. If so, the datagram 
can be sent directly. Otherwise, the system expects to find an entry for the 
network that the destination address is on. The datagram is sent to the gateway 
listed in that entry. This table can get quite big. For example, the Internet 
now includes several hundred individual networks. Thus various strategies have 
been developed to reduce the size of the routing table. One strategy is to 
depend upon "default routes". Often, there is only one gateway out of a network. 
This gateway might connect a local Ethernet to a campus-wide backbone network. 
In that case, we don't need to have a separate entry for every network in the 
world. We simply define that gateway as a "default". When no specific route is 
found for a datagram, the datagram is sent to the default gateway. A default 
gateway can even be used when there are several gateways on a network. There are 
provisions for gateways to send a message saying "I'm not the best gateway -- 
use this one instead." (The message is sent via ICMP. See RFC 792.) Most network 
software is designed to use these messages to add entries to their routing 
tables. Suppose network 128.6.4 has two gateways, 128.6.4.59 and 128.6.4.1. 
128.6.4.59 leads to several other internal Rutgers networks. 128.6.4.1 leads 
indirectly to the NSFnet. Suppose we set 128.6.4.59 as a default gateway, and 
have no other routing table entries. Now what happens when we need to send a 
datagram to MIT? MIT is network 18. Since we have no entry for network 18, the 
datagram will be sent to the default, 128.6.4.59. As it happens, this gateway is 
the wrong one. So it will forward the datagram to 128.6.4.1. But it will also 
send back an error saying in effect: "to get to network 18, use 128.6.4.1". Our 
software will then add an entry to the routing table. Any future datagrams to 
MIT will then go directly to 128.6.4.1. (The error message is sent using the 
ICMP protocol. The message type is called "ICMP redirect.") 
<P>Most IP experts recommend that individual computers should not try to keep 
track of the entire network. Instead, they should start with default gateways, 
and let the gateways tell them the routes, as just described. However this 
doesn't say how the gateways should find out about the routes. The gateways 
can't depend upon this strategy. They have to have fairly complete routing 
tables. For this, some sort of routing protocol is needed. A routing protocol is 
simply a technique for the gateways to find each other, and keep up to date 
about the best way to get to every network. RFC 1009 contains a review of 
gateway design and routing. However rip.doc is probably a better introduction to 
the subject. It contains some tutorial material, and a detailed description of 
the most commonly-used routing protocol.
