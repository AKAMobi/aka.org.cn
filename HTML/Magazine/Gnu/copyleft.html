<h3><a HREF="/copyleft/copyleft.html#TOCWhatIsCopyleft" NAME="WhatIsCopyleft">What Is 
Copyleft?</a></h3>

<p>The simplest way to make a program free is to put it in the <a
HREF="/philosophy/categories.html#PublicDomainSoftware">public domain (18k characters)</a>, 
uncopyrighted. This allows people to share the program and their improvements, if they are 
so minded. But it also allows uncooperative people to convert the program into <a
HREF="/philosophy/categories.html#ProprietarySoftware">proprietary software (18k 
characters)</a>. They can make changes, many or few, and distribute the result as a 
proprietary product. People who receive the program in that modified form do not have the 
freedom that the original author gave them; the middleman has stripped it away. </p>

<p>In the GNU project, our aim is to give <em>all</em> users the freedom to redistribute 
and change GNU software. If middlemen could strip off the freedom, we might have many 
users, but those users would not have freedom. So instead of putting GNU software in the 
public domain, we ``copyleft'' it. Copyleft says that anyone who redistributes the 
software, with or without changes, must pass along the freedom to further copy and change 
it. Copyleft guarantees that every user has freedom. </p>

<p>Copyleft also provides an <a HREF="/philosophy/pragmatic.html">incentive</a> for other 
programmers to add to free software. Important free programs such as the GNU C++ compiler 
exist only because of this. </p>

<p>Copyleft also helps programmers who want to contribute <a
HREF="/software/software.html#HelpWriteSoftware">improvements</a> to <a
HREF="/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a> get permission to do that. These 
programmers often work for companies or universities that would do almost anything to get 
more money. A programmer may want to contribute her changes to the community, but her 
employer may want to turn the changes into a proprietary software product. </p>

<p>When we explain to the employer that it is illegal to distribute the improved version 
except as free software, the employer usually decides to release it as free software 
rather than throw it away. </p>

<p>To copyleft a program, first we copyright it; then we add distribution terms, which are 
a legal instrument that gives everyone the rights to use, modify, and redistribute the 
program's code <em>or any program derived from it</em> but only if the distribution terms 
are unchanged. Thus, the code and the freedoms become legally inseparable. </p>

<p>Proprietary software developers use copyright to take away the users' freedom; we use 
copyright to guarantee their freedom. That's why we reverse the name, changing 
``copyright'' into ``copyleft.'' </p>

<p>Copyleft is a general concept; there are many ways to fill in the details. In the GNU 
Project, the specific distribution terms that we use are contained in the <a
HREF="/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License (20k characters HTML</a><a
HREF="/copyleft/gpl.txt"> or 18k characters text)</a> (GNU GPL). An alternate form, the <a
HREF="/copyleft/lgpl.html">GNU Library General Public License (27k characters HTML</a><a
HREF="/copyleft/lgpl.txt"> or 25k characters text)</a> (GNU LGPL), applies to a few (but 
not all) GNU libraries. The library license permits linking the libraries into proprietary 
executables under certain conditions. </p>

<p>The appropriate license is included in many manuals and in each GNU source code 
distribution (usually in files named <a HREF="/copyleft/COPYING">COPYING (20k characters, 
plain text)</a> and <a HREF="/copyleft/COPYING.LIB">COPYING.LIB (27k characters, plain 
text)</a>). </p>

<p>The GNU GPL is designed so that you can easily apply it to your own program if you are 
the copyright holder. You don't have to modify the GNU GPL to do this, just add notices to 
your program which refer properly to the GNU GPL. </p>

<p>If you would like to copyleft your program with the GNU GPL, please see the 
instructions at the <a HREF="/copyleft/gpl.html#SEC4">end (20k characters)</a> of the GPL 
text. If you would like to copyleft your library with the GNU LGPL, please see the 
instructions at the <a HREF="/copyleft/lgpl.html#SEC4">end (27k characters)</a> of the 
LGPL text (note you can also use the <a HREF="/copyleft/gpl.html">ordinary GPL</a> for 
libraries). </p>

<p>Using the same distribution terms for many different programs makes it easy to copy 
code between various different programs. Since they all have the same distribution terms, 
there is no need to think about whether the terms are compatible. The Library GPL includes 
a provision that lets you alter the distribution terms to the ordinary GPL, so that you 
can copy code into another program covered by the GPL. </p>

<h4><a HREF="/copyleft/copyleft.html#TOCtranslations" NAME="translations">Translations of 
the GPL</a></h4>

<p>Here are some translations of the GNU GPL done by others. 

<ul>
  <li><a HREF="http://meta.mioc.hr/GPL.html">A Croatian translation</a> of the GPL. </li>
  <li><a HREF="http://www.linux-france.com/article/these/gpl.html">A French translation</a> of 
    the GPL. </li>
  <li><a HREF="http://agnes.dida.physik.uni-essen.de/~gnu-pascal/gpl-ger.html">A German 
    translation</a> of the GPL. </li>
  <li><a HREF="http://animal.unipv.it/gnu/gpl.txt">An Italian translation </a>of the GPL. </li>
  <li><a HREF="http://www.cyber.co.kr/~chsong/scitech&amp;movement/gnu/gpl-k.html">A Korean 
    translation</a> of the GPL. </li>
  <li><a HREF="ftp://ftp.sra.co.jp/pub/gnu/local-fix/GPL2-j">A Japanese translation</a> of the 
    GPL. </li>
  <li><a HREF="http://www-ru.gnu.org.ru/GPL.rus">A Russian translation</a> of the GPL. <!-- Removed temporarily because it was badly translated, the author
     has agreed to change some wording but we havn't heard from him yet
<LI><A HREF="http://visar.csustan.edu/~carlos/gpl-es.html">A
     Spanish translation</A> of the GPL.
     --> </li>
</ul>

<p>These versions are not official. Legally speaking, the original (English) version of 
the GPL is what specifies the actual distribution terms for GNU programs. </p>

<p>The reason the FSF does not approve these translations as officially valid is that 
checking them would be difficult and expensive (needing the help of bilingual lawyers in 
other countries). Even worse, if an error did slip through, the results could be 
disastrous for the whole free software community. As long as the translations are 
unofficial, they can't do any harm, and we hope they help more people understand the GPL. </p>

<p>We permit unofficial translations of the GPL into other languages, but this is not 
automatic; please contact us before publishing one. One thing we want you to do is add the 
following text at the beginning, both in English and in the language of the 
translation---replacing <em>language</em> with the name of that language: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is an unofficial translation of the GNU General Public License into <em>language</em>. 
  It was not published by the Free Software Foundation, and does not legally state the 
  distribution terms for software that uses the GNU GPL--only the original English text of 
  the GNU GPL does that. However, we hope that this translation will help <em>language</em> 
  speakers understand the GNU GPL better. </p>
</blockquote>
