      <p><i><span lang=EN-US>Typically, there are three main factors important 
        to the success of a software development project: time, cost, and quality 
        (Figure 1). When we toss these three &quot;darts,&quot; however, we often 
        miss the bull's-eye, for a number of reasons.</span></i><span lang=EN-US></span></p>
      <p><i><span lang=EN-US>In Sweden, one notable failure was a software project 
        at the Swedish Patent and Registration Office, which contracted a large 
        software development firm to implement a Web solution for companies to 
        register themselves online with the Patent and Registration Office. The 
        planned release was to be 1998 at an approximate cost of $15 million. 
        But the system was actually delivered in September 2000, still incomplete, 
        at a cost of $25 million.</span></i><span lang=EN-US> </span></p>

      <p><i><span lang=EN-US>Why do projects fail? There have been many books 
        and research articles on the subject, but it is safe to say that failure 
        stems from both external and internal factors. An external factor, for 
        example, might be that the product is already &quot;old&quot; and useless 
        by the time it is developed; that is, it is based on out-of-date technology 
        that makes the product cumbersome to use. Other possible external factors 
        include key personnel leaving the project or customers changing the requirements 
        specifications. These are all factors that you, as a software developer, 
        cannot control.</span></i><span
  lang=EN-US> </span></p>
      <p><i><span lang=EN-US>One factor that you can control, however, is an internal 
        one: the software development process. A defined and mature process usually 
        results in good products. Furthermore, using such a process becomes more 
        and more important as systems continue to grow in complexity and size.</span></i><span lang=EN-US></span></p>
      <h3><span lang=EN-US>Software Development Processes</span></h3>
      <p><span lang=EN-US>Today, there are a number of software development processes: 
        the Capability Maturity Model (CMM), the Rational Unified Process (RUP<sup>®</sup>), 
        the Personal Software Process (PSP), and the Team Software Process (TSP), 
        to name a few. Most of these processes focus on just one dimension regarding 
        support for process improvement. The RUP and CMM, for example, provide 
        support for software development at an organizational level; the TSP provides 
        support at a team level; and the PSP provides it at an individual level. 
        </span></p>
      <p><span lang=EN-US>Processes like the RUP and the TSP support teams and 
        organizations to develop software but do not support the software processes 
        of the individuals in the organizations. The focus and effort of coordinating 
        work activities at a team level leaves out guidelines for the workers. 
        As a consequence, it is more or less up to the individual worker to find 
        ways to monitor, control, and improve his own personal software development 
        process.</span></p>
      <h5><span lang=EN-US>The Rational Unified Process (RUP)</span></h5>
      <p><span lang=EN-US>The RUP defines process elements such as workers, activities, 
        and artifacts that, when combined properly, will help an organization 
        conduct a software project efficiently. The process itself, however, does 
        not provide any magical solutions. It is the workers -- actual human beings 
        -- who are the driving force of the project. Without human participants, 
        no process or tool in the world could alone finish a software project. 
        The end results -- whether the project finished on time and whether the 
        released system was of high quality -- depend to a great extent on the 
        quality of participants' individual software processes. </span></p>
      <p><span lang=EN-US>The RUP provides a knowledge base of information that 
        helps workers do a better job. It differs from the approach used in the 
        PSP, however, which provides the software engineer with more explicit 
        support. Instead, the RUP provides a framework for how, what, when, and 
        by whom various activities should take place in order to get a satisfying 
        result. In other words, an organization using RUP will do well if it has 
        competent and experienced people -- and will certainly do better than 
        an organization with incompetent and inexperienced employees that attempts 
        to use the RUP. It is always important for organizations with inexperienced 
        people to quickly improve their employees' skills in order to save time 
        and money. The RUP does not provide an answer to this issue of employee 
        competence.</span></p>
      <h5><span lang=EN-US>The Personal Software Process (PSP)</span></h5>
      <p><span lang=EN-US>The PSP, in contrast, does address this employee improvement 
        issue. The PSP is a framework for software process improvement for the 
        individual software engineer. Watts Humphrey at the Software Engineering 
        Institute (SEI) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, developed it in 1995. The 
        PSP provides metrics, process-steps, and templates that help an engineer 
        improve her software engineering skills. Research results indicate significant 
        process improvements among software engineers applying the PSP. Factors 
        like productivity, number of injected defects, and time and size estimations 
        tend to improve when the PSP is applied. </span></p>
      <p><span lang=EN-US>Figure 2 shows the PSP's process maturity levels. PSP0 
        is the most basic level, enabling the software engineer to establish a 
        ground floor development process, whereas PSP3 is the most complex, with 
        a number of metrics and templates available to the software engineer.</span></p>
      <p align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US><img

      <h6 align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>Figure 2: The 
        PSP's Process Maturity Levels</span></h6>
      <h3><span lang=EN-US>How the PSP Can Support the RUP</span></h3>
      <p><span lang=EN-US>In light of these positive results from applying the 
        PSP, we might assume that similar process improvement awareness in the 
        RUP would help workers improve their own processes, thereby enhancing 
        the results of an organization as a whole. If you study and compare the 
        PSP with the RUP, it becomes obvious that the PSP has process improvement 
        concepts that can be applied in the RUP. </span></p>
      <p><span lang=EN-US>The main advantages of incorporating the PSP into the 
        RUP are as follows: </span></p>
      <ul type=disc>
        <li><b><span lang=EN-US>Task and schedule planning template.</span></b><span lang=EN-US> 
          The RUP provides limited support to team members on how to manage work 
          within an iteration. In the RUP, iterations can last for weeks or months. 
          The project manager (or other lead) assigns tasks and responsibilities 
          to project participants. It is up to the individual worker, however, 
          to plan his work during the iteration. The RUP does not provide any 
          support for this. The PSP, in contrast, provides task and schedule planning 
          templates to monitor project progress. With these tools, software engineers 
          can track their progress and know when they are slipping behind schedule. 
          They can then inform the project manager about this status so that appropriate 
          corrective actions can be taken. </span></li>
        <li><b><span lang=EN-US>Checklists based on personal defect data.</span></b><span lang=EN-US> 
          The workers in the RUP do not perform reviews based on personal defect 
          data. Rather, they have checklists based on the most typical defect 
          types collected in the organization. As a consequence, software engineers 
          could be looking for defect types they never inject. The PSP, on the 
          other hand, has checklists that are based on personal defect data. So 
          software engineers will be looking for defect types they usually inject. 
          </span></li>
        <li><b><span lang=EN-US>Templates to record ideas for, and help move toward, 
          process improvement.</span></b><span
       lang=EN-US> <br>
          The RUP does not provide templates for writing down ideas for process 
          improvement, but the PSP <i>does</i> provides templates for software 
          engineers to record ideas as well as tasks to perform later on in the 
          project. </span></li>
        <li><b><span lang=EN-US>Metrics to help improve process.</span></b><span lang=EN-US> 
          The RUP does not provide predefined metrics that software engineers 
          can use to monitor and control their software processes. Before each 
          new project, metrics must be defined and explained to all project participants. 
          There is no guarantee, however, that the defined metrics offer the kind 
          of information a software engineer wants or needs in order to monitor 
          his software development process. In these cases, it is up to the software 
          engineer to define and apply appropriate metrics. The PSP, in contrast, 
          has a number of metrics that provide information on improving the personal 
          software development process. </span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span lang=EN-US>Unfortunately, the PSP material cannot be applied directly 
        by workers using RUP; it must be modified so that it suits the RUP context. 
        If every RUP project were conducted in the same manner -- that is, if 
        all artifacts, activities, workflows, lifecycle models, and so on, never 
        changed -- then the PSP material would only need to be adapted once. This 
        is not the case, however. Every project is unique and needs to be conducted 
        in a particular way in order to be successful. This means that the RUP 
        material -- activities, artifacts, and workflows -- must be modified and 
        defined for the particular project at hand. </span></p>
      <h5><span lang=EN-US>PSP Toolboxes for RUP Personnel</span></h5>
      <p><span lang=EN-US>To address the opportunity to support the RUP with the 
        PSP, we defined &quot;PSP Toolboxes&quot; for workers whose tasks are 
        part of both processes: those who do design, code, and test activities. 
        The toolboxes contain process scripts, templates, and metrics (see Figure 
        3) for workers using the RUP to apply, enabling them to analyze and control 
        their software development processes. </span></p>
      <p align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US><img
  border=0 width=504 height=266 id="_x0000_i1088"
  src="../images/i26.gif"
  alt="Figure 3"></span></p>
      <h6 align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>Figure 3: A 
        PSP Toolbox with Process Improvement Elements for Workers Using the RUP</span></h6>
      <p><span lang=EN-US>We designed unique PSP Toolboxes for each of five workers 
        defined in the RUP: <i>Implementer, Integrator, Test Designer, Tester, 
        and Designer</i>. They all work in PSP-related activities and, furthermore, 
        they were perceived as the main candidates for applying the PSP material. 
        There are other workers in the RUP who also work with PSP activities, 
        but to a lesser degree. For example, the <i>Capsule Designer</i> deals 
        with concurrency issues, and can be viewed as a narrower version of the 
        <i>Designer</i>. As a consequence, the work was restricted to defining 
        PSP Toolboxes for the main worker categories mentioned above. It should 
        be noted, however, that every worker in RUP ought to have a process improvement 
        framework of his own, specially defined for that individual worker's needs 
        and work environment. As the saying goes, however, that is another story; 
        we will not address that issue here.</span></p>
      <h5><span lang=EN-US>Incorporating the PSP into the RUP</span></h5>
      <p><span lang=EN-US>So far so good. We have defined PSP Toolboxes for five 
        chosen workers, and the material in those Toolboxes helps the workers 
        monitor and control their software development processes. Two things, 
        however, are still missing. First, a new process -- in this case the PSP 
        -- should be introduced into an organization in a proper way. Experience 
        tells us that the general guidelines presented in Table 1 are effective 
        for process introductions. </span></p>

          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p><span lang=EN-US>Second, the material in the PSP Toolboxes needs to be 
        adapted and adjusted for each individual project. For instance, size metrics 
        should be defined for software development projects, so that team members 
        can measure the size of the products and estimate time and effort. It 
        is impossible to know beforehand, however, whether the worker in question 
        will apply, for example, Lines Of Code (LOC) or Function Points (FP), 
        to name just two size metrics. The choice of metric may depend on the 
        type of application developed or the tool used in the development effort. 
        In addition, it is also impossible to know beforehand if the worker in 
        question will count physical or logical lines if LOC is used, or what 
        kinds of factors and weights he or she will choose if FP is used. As this 
        small example illustrates, for any project, the people actually using 
        the PSP Toolboxes should be the ones who adapt the contents in those toolboxes.

        will be reviewed in the same areas and documented in a similar way, thereby 
        easing the incorporation of the PSP into the RUP.</span></p>

      <p><span lang=EN-US>The main advantages of supporting the RUP with the PSP 
        are presented in Table 4. Maybe the most important advantage that the 
        PSP provides is the drive for personal excellence. The PSP stresses that 
        personal commitment and excellence are factors that have a major impact 
        on process improvement results. Software engineers should always strive 
        to do the best they can. That way, they will never be disappointed with 
        respect to their efforts. Employees with this kind of commitment always 
        outperform those who do not care about their work results, as long as 
        the paychecks keep coming. The PSP helps people strive for personal excellence.

      <p><span lang=EN-US>It is important to remember that the software development 
        process should provide support for all levels of work: for individuals 
        as well as teams and organizations. The purpose of having defined processes 
        is to ensure that the work ahead can be performed with a reasonably high 
        degree of quality. &quot;A chain is only as strong as its weakest link,&quot; 
        as the saying goes. A project depends on the individuals involved in it, 
        and these individuals, therefore, should have maximum support for improving 
        their work routines. This is where the PSP can enhance the RUP.</span></p>
