		Installnation and Configuration for D2Close Server
Last Update: 05-03-2001

Part I: D2Close

	For Linux user:

	firstly,unzip the linux binary into a directory (we recommend to add a 
sparate user instead of root to run the server for secure reason,e.g d2server)
here,we suppose it to be /home/d2server, and the unzipped directory struct 
will be like /home/d2server/var, /home/d2server/etc ...

	secondly,unzip the data package with the file directory into 
/home/d2server/var/files (or any place you wish,this also can be set in config file)

	then,edit the configuration file /home/d2server/etc/bnetd.conf to 
suit yourself.there are some comments in that file, and the default setting
is ok in most case.i just point out some one necessary to change:
	I).do a global replace with the directory in the config file.
here,we change /usr/local/d2close/ to /home/d2server/
	II).change all ip address settings. 
	1)."realmaddr" is point to the auth server address(handling character,game,
ladder request, currenctly builtin with d2close,so should be the same as d2close server
ip address,care,you can not use internal ip address or loopback one,e.g 127.0.0.1, for 
this address is also for client to use)
	2)."d2localservaddr" currently builtin with the d2close server too,should also 
be same ip as d2close server.
	3)."d2remoteservaddr" should be the GameServer ip address, multi ip address
can be specified sparating by ','. this address is just for server use now,so can be
internal one. e.g. 166.111.2.1,192.168.2.1 will sepecify two game servers.

	ok now, try chmod u+x /home/d2server/bnetd_dynamic, and run it.
on most linux system with glibc >= 2.0 , it should be ok, anyway,if the dynamic
linked version failed to run,try bnetd_static instead. still not work? recompile
with source and try again.
	when starting the server, you should set the argument to point out
the config file(the default one is set on compiling),as the above example.
use /home/d2server/bnetd_dynamic -c /home/d2server/etc/bnetd.conf
or /home/d2server/bnetd_dynamic --cfg=/home/d2server/etc/bnetd.conf, for a complete
list of arguments, try run using argument -h ( or --help)
	
	if all works fine here, the server will automatically run in background
as a daemon(without -f argument),  and from the log file (/home/d2server/var/logs/bnetd.log)
you will see the message like "server_process: listening on 0.0.0.0:6112 TCP"
	
	For Win32 user:
	the step is familiar with the linux version, instead of cbnetd.exe is console
version of server and wbnetd.exe is windows version of it ( no frontend now :( )
	and by now, the win32 version may have some compatible problem,so better to 
use the linux version.

Part II: Game Server
	The Game Server currently only support win32.
	First of all,unzip the package into any directory you wish,we suppose it to be
c:\d2server.
	secondly, copy the file d2data.mpq from Diablo2 game into c:\d2server
	then, for Nt & 2k user, run c:\d2server\d2svc.exe -i to install it as a
system service, and start it by "net start d2svc" (also you can control this
from service control manager). for 9x user, run c:\d2server\d2svc.exe directly.
run under Nt or 2k as system service is suggested.
	if the game server start sucessfully, you will found a message from 
c:\d2server\d2svc.log "Main server started successfully,Server id is ..." and
also found port 4321 is listening

	all done, lanuch your Diablo2 Client(only support 1.03 now), and point the 
battle.net server ip to the d2close server, and you can enjoy the great game now.
	
	
Part III: some admin commands. (need admin or announce privilege)

	1. /shutdown [n]
	shutdown the server after 'n' minutes, if n is zero, cancel the previous
shutdown. (you will need to write a script if you want the server auto restart)
	
	2. /d2server
	view the game server status, the output format is:
server Id:ip-----------------Status----Max---Token----Games
id is needed for other game server maintenance command, status indicate whether
a game server is running. Max is that server's max game number,
Token is for game sync, Games is game number currently running on
that server.

	3. /maxgame [server id] [maxgame]
	set server [id] maxgame number to maxgame,you can set maxgame to zero
to tempory disable a game server( no new game will be created on that server,but
currently running games on that server will continued)

	4. /retest
	retest status of all game servers.

	5. /add [server ip]
	dynamic add a game server into game server list.
	
	6. /del [server ip]
	dynamic delete a game server from game server list.	

	most other command reference can be found by using /help
command.
