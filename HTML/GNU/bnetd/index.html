Version: 0.1.0pre1<br>    
Current Build:		Dec 2, 2000</font><font size="3"><br>

<font size="4">Introduction:</font><br>    
	This project is aims to emulate <a href="http://www.blizzard.com">blizzard</a>`s diablo2 realm server<br>      
it comes from the <a href="http://www.bnetd.org"> bnetd</a> project ( www.bnetd.org ).<br>

<font size="4">Some details:</font><br>      
	This project is to emulate diablo2(a great game comes from blizzard)closed      
battle.net.It is just under testing by now.This program do not really run a game engineer,which is hard to emulate i think.(fsgs      
is working on this),it just act as common battle.net server,let players to chat,create or join      
games on it,the game engineer is just inherit the game from blizzard.the battle.net server makes<br>      
a pipe to it and parse some data.for more details,please look into the source code.<br>      
	the realm server will be unstable until now,that`s true.for the game engineer is done      
by blizzard,which we don`t know exactly how it works and which do not purpose working as server.      
it is hard to let blizzard open their server program to public,so this is just we can do by now.(of cuz,there will need some patch on the origin game)<br>      
<br>      
<font size="4">Support and Requirement:</font><br>      
	It support most unix like system and windows.I only tested it on Sun solaris,&nbsp;<br>     
linux ,win9x,nt &amp; 2k.<br>      
	if you just want to run binary, you only need the binary package and data package.<br>      
	if you want to compiler it, for unix users,you will need gcc and make utils, for windows users, you will need  
make and a win32 c compiler,e.g lcc,borland c or visual c, i personally use lcc ;)<br>      
<br>      
<font size="4"><br>     
Features and how to use it:</font><br>      
	this program mainly comes from bnetd-0.4.21 and bnetd-0.4.23pre9,so it inherit most features from bnetd--which support starcraft,broodwar,diablo and warcraftII BNE.most new      
features are for diablo2 closed battle.net. the documents in the program is just from bnetd      
by now,and also,i have not enough time to comment the newly added source code.sorry about that,and later if i got time,i will added them in.to use it,just do as origin bnetd,make proper configuration in the config file(of cuz,there will be some new entry in it for realm,which is easy to understand),the document of bnetd      
have details information on how to use it.<br>      
	additionally,if you want to make the server support realm game,you should download the      
game server and runs it,then add an entry to the diablo2 game server chain.(use /add command)<br>      
<br>      
<br>      
<font size="4">Development:</font><br>     
	I am not familiar about bnetd and battle.net at the beginning ( which i just got to<br>      
known when diablo2 comes out),and until now,there only i oneself works on it, code,crack,test      
and etc... so i really want someone else to join it.if you are interested in it,contact me ;)<br>      
<br>      
<br>

	lots,but not collected by now.<br>
