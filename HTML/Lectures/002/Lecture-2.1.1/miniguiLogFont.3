.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBCreateLogFont\fP function creates a logical font. Note that the size of logical font may be different from the size expected, and you can specify \fBrotation\fP only for TrueType font. The \fBrotation\fP is in units of tenth degrees.
.PP
\fBCreateLogFontIndirect\fP function creates a logical font. Note that the size of logical font may be different from the size expected.
.PP
\fBDestroyLogFont\fP function destroys a logical font \fB(log_font)\fP.
.PP
\fBGetSystemFont\fP function retrives the system logical font. \fBfont_id\fP is the identifier of system font. So far, you can only use \fBSYSLOGFONT_DEFAULT\fP as the value.
.PP
\fBGetCurFont\fP function retrives the current logical font in the DC. When initializes a DC, MiniGUI will set system font as its default logical font. 
.PP
\fBSelectFont\fP function selects a logical font into the DC. This function returns the handle to the old logical font.
